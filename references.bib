abstract = "The CRISPR-Cpf1 endonuclease has recently been demonstrated as a powerful tool to manipulate targeted gene sequences. Here, we performed an extensive screening of split Cpf1 fragments and identified a pair that, combined with inducible dimerization domains, enables chemical- and light-inducible genome editing in human cells. We also identified another split Cpf1 pair that is spontaneously activated. The newly generated amino and carboxyl termini of the spontaneously activated split Cpf1 can be repurposed as de novo fusion sites of artificial effector domains. Based on this finding, we generated an improved split dCpf1 activator, which has the potential to activate endogenous genes more efficiently than a previously established dCas9 activator. Finally, we showed that the split dCpf1 activator can efficiently activate target genes in mice. These results demonstrate that the present split Cpf1 provides an efficient and sophisticated genome manipulation in the fields of basic research and biotechnological applications.",

abstract = "Protein splicing elements, termed inteins, have been discovered in all the domains of life. Basic research on inteins has led to a greater understanding of how they mediate the protein splicing process. Because inteins are natural protein engineering elements they have been harnessed for use in a number of applications, including protein purification, protein semisynthesis, and in vivo and in vitro protein modifications. This review focuses on the use of inteins in plants. A split-gene technique utilizes inteins to reconstitute the activity of a transgene product with the goal of limiting the spread of transgenes from a genetically modified plant to a weedy relative. Furthermore, merging the intein tag for protein purification with the large protein yields possible with plants has the potential to produce pharmaceutically important proteins. Finally, relevant techniques that may be used in plants in the future are discussed.",

It is capable of catalyzing a protein trans-splicing mechanism to assemble a mature protein from two separate precursors. Therefore, it is a powerful tool for protein modification and engineering. Inteins have not been identified, nor have intein-mediated protein splicing reactions been demonstrated, in plant cells. In this paper, we describe the use of the Ssp DnaE split intein in transgenic plants for reconstitution of a protein trans-splicing reaction. We have synthesized artificial genes that encode for N-terminal half (Int-n) and C-terminal half (Int-c) fragments of Ssp DnaE split intein and divided beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene to encode GUS-n and GUS-c parts of the enzyme as reporter. The in-frame fusions of GUSn/Intn and Intc/GUSc were constructed and transfected into Arabidopsis. We have observed in vivo reassembly of functional beta-glucuronidase when both GUSn/Intn and Intc/GUSc constructs were introduced into the same Arabidopsis genome either by cotransformation or through genetic crossing, hereby signifying an intein-mediated protein trans-splicing mechanism reconstituted in plant cells.",

abstract = "CRISPR-Cas systems are widespread adaptive antiviral systems used in prokaryotes. Some phages, in turn, although have small genomes can economize the use of genetic space to encode compact or incomplete CRISPR-Cas systems to inhibit the host and establish infection. Phage ICP1, infecting Vibrio cholerae, encodes a compact type I-F CRISPR-Cas system to suppress the antiphage mobile genetic element in the host genome. However, the mechanism by which this compact system recognizes the target DNA and executes interference remains elusive. Here, we present the electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of both apo- and DNA-bound ICP1 surveillance complexes (Aka Csy complex). Unlike most other type I surveillance complexes, the ICP1 Csy complex lacks the Cas11 subunit or a structurally homologous domain, which is crucial for dsDNA binding and Cas3 activation in other type I CRISPR-Cas systems. Structural and functional analyses revealed that the compact ICP1 Csy complex alone is inefficient in binding to dsDNA targets, presumably stalled at a partial R-loop conformation. The presence of Cas2/3 facilitates dsDNA binding and allows effective dsDNA target cleavage. Additionally, we found that Pseudomonas aeruginosa Cas2/3 efficiently cleaved the dsDNA target presented by the ICP1 Csy complex, but not vice versa. These findings suggest a unique mechanism for target dsDNA binding and cleavage by the compact phage-derived CRISPR-Cas system.",

The recent demonstration of an intrinsic 5′-deoxyribose-5′-phosphate lyase activity, a template/primer dependent polymerase activity, a distributive manner of DNA synthesis and sequence similarity to DNA polymerase $\beta$ suggested a novel $\beta$-like enzyme. All these properties support a role of DNA polymerase $\lambda$ in base excision repair. On the other hand, the biochemical properties of the polymerisation activity of DNA polymerase $\lambda$ are still largely unknown. Here we give evidence that human DNA polymerase $\lambda$ has an intrinsic terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase activity that preferentially adds pyrimidines onto 3′OH ends of DNA oligonucleotides. Furthermore, human DNA polymerase $\lambda$ efficiently elongates an RNA primer hybridized to a DNA template. These two novel properties of human DNA polymerase $\lambda$ might suggest additional roles for this enzyme in DNA replication and repair processes.",

An exchange of a 20-bp spacer sequence in the gRNA can easily reprogram Cas9 to target a different DNA site. By expressing or providing multiple gRNAs, the system also enables multiplex genome editing at high efficiencies. Current approaches for providing multiple gRNAs in vivo include the use of multigene cassettes to express several gRNAs, Csy4-based excision, arrays of crRNAs, ribozyme-flanked gRNAs, tRNA-dependent cleavage of gRNAs, and direct introduction of Cas9 proteins preloaded with different gRNAs. By simultaneously targeting multiple DNA sequences, multiplex genome editing can be used to knockout multiple genes or delete chromosomal fragments. Off-target risk can also be reduced by Cas9-dimers that require the simultaneous expression of two gRNAs. With multiple gRNAs, specific gene expression or methylation status can be efficiently controlled by dCas9 fused to activators, repressors, methyltransferase, demethylase, or other functional domains. As a result, multiplex genome editing is expected to accelerate functional discovery of plant genes as well as genetic improvement of agricultural crops.",

Availability of transformation methods markedly expand the application of a model. We chose to develop an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer method for Setaria viridis A10.1. Regenerable callus was recovered from mature seeds without seed coats that were disinfected and cultured on a Murashige and Skoog-based medium supplemented with 40 g/L maltose, 2 mg/L 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 0.5 mg/L kinetin, and 4 g/L Gelzan. The gelling agents Gelzan and Phytagel were found to be critical for recovery of a high quality callus as compared to agar that resulted in a gelatinous, brown, non-regenerable callus. For transformation, the callus was infected with the A. tumefaciens strain AGL1 that contained binary vectors with the hygromycin phosphotransferase selectable marker gene, which confers resistance to the antibiotic hygromycin. The transformation efficiency, which is defined as the percent of infected callus that gives rise to at least one independent transgenic line ranged from 0.3 to 15 \% depending upon the vector backbone used to design constructs and the gene of interest that was either overexpressed or had a knockdown of expression. Transgenic lines were first verified by PCR, then positive plants were moved forward for copy number determination by either Southern or TaqMan\textregistered{} analysis. On average, 42 \% of the transgenic lines contained one copy of the introduced transgene.

abstract = "Three of the four family X polymerases, DNA polymerase lambda, DNA polymerase mu, and TdT, have been associated with repair of double-strand DNA breaks by nonhomologous end-joining. Their involvement in this DNA repair process requires an N-terminal BRCT domain that mediates interaction with other protein factors required for recognition and binding of broken DNA ends. Here we present the NMR solution structure of the BRCT domain of DNA polymerase lambda, completing the structural portrait for this family of enzymes. Analysis of the overall fold of the polymerase lambda BRCT domain reveals structural similarity to the BRCT domains of polymerase mu and TdT, yet highlights some key sequence and structural differences that may account for important differences in the biological activities of these enzymes and their roles in nonhomologous end-joining. Mutagenesis studies indicate that the conserved Arg57 residue of Pol lambda plays a more critical role for binding to the XRCC4-Ligase IV complex than its structural homolog in Pol mu, Arg43. In contrast, the hydrophobic Leu60 residue of Pol lambda contributes less significantly to binding than the structurally homologous Phe46 residue of Pol mu. A third leucine residue involved in the binding and activity of Pol mu, is nonconservatively replaced by a glutamine in Pol lambda (Gln64) and, based on binding and activity data, is apparently unimportant for Pol lambda interactions with the NHEJ complex. In conclusion, both the structure of the Pol lambda BRCT domain and its mode of interaction with the other components of the NHEJ complex significantly differ from the two previously studied homologs, Pol mu and TdT.",

Here, utilizing the highly efficient multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing system, we created single- and multiple-knockout mutants for all the nine DNA methyltransferases in rice (Oryza sativa) and profiled their whole-genome methylation status at single-nucleotide resolution. Surprisingly, the simultaneous loss of DRM2, CHROMOMETHYLASE3 (CMT2), and CMT3 functions, which completely erases all non-CG methylation in Arabidopsis, only partially reduced it in rice. The regions that remained heavily methylated in non-CG contexts in the rice Os-dcc (Osdrm2/cmt2/cmt3a) triple mutant had high GC contents. Furthermore, the residual non-CG methylation in the Os-dcc mutant was eliminated in the Os-ddccc (Osdrm2/drm3/cmt2/cmt3a/cmt3b) quintuple mutant but retained in the Os-ddcc (Osdrm2/drm3/cmt2/cmt3a) quadruple mutant, demonstrating that OsCMT3b maintains non-CG methylation in the absence of other major methyltransferases.

The profiles of the associated gene-editing events were similar to those identified in human cell lines and consequently are predictable using an existing algorithm originally designed for human studies. We observed unexpected but frequent homology-directed repair through endogenous templates that was likely caused by spatial contact between distinct chromosomes. Based on the characterization and interpretation of gene function from several examples, we demonstrate that the integration of forward and reverse genetics via a targeted mutagenesis library promises rapid validation of important agronomic genes for crops with complex genomes.

One of the most significant uses of this technique is for generation of sequencing templates, either from cloned inserts or directly from genomic DNA. To avoid the problem of reassociation of the linear DNA strands in the sequencing reaction, ssDNA templates can be produced directly in the PCR or generated directly from dsDNA by enzymatic treatment, electrophoretic separation or affinity purification. By combining PCR with direct sequencing, both the amplification and the sequencing reaction can be performed in the same vial. Finally, use of fluorescently labeled terminators or sequencing primers will allow the whole procedure to be amenable to complete automation.",

Each modification independently improved prime editing efficiency by ~1.8-3.4-fold in plant cells.

No significant increase in byproducts or off-target editing was observed. We used the ePPE to generate rice plants tolerant to sulfonylurea and imidazolinone herbicides, observing an editing frequency of 11.3\% compared with 2.1\% using PPE.

It offers recommendations to ensure that America reaps the benefits of this developing field within appropriate ethical boundaries. The Bioethics Commission approached this task through inclusive and deliberative engagement with ethicists, scientists, engineers, and individuals in faith, business, and non-profit communities. It held three public meetings, both in and outside of Washington, D.C., created an open forum for dialogue, and heard many diverse voices. The Bioethics Commission found that synthetic biology offers extraordinary promise to create new products for clean energy, pollution control, and medicine, to revolutionize chemical production and manufacturing, and to create new economic opportunities. With this promise comes a duty to attend carefully to potential risks, be responsible stewards, and consider thoughtfully the implications for humans, other species, nature, and the environment. The Bioethics Commission concluded that synthetic biology is capable of significant but limited achievements posing limited risks. Future developments may raise further objections, but the Commission found no reason to endorse additional federal regulations or a moratorium on work in this field at this time. Instead, the Commission urges monitoring and dialogue between the private and public sectors to achieve open communication and cooperation. The Bioethics Commission recommends that the government, through a coordinated process or body within the Executive Office of the President, lead an ongoing review of developments, risks, opportunities, and oversight as this field grows. This review should be in consultation with relevant scientific, academic, international, and public communities, and whenever possible its results should be made public. It also recommends that reasonable risk assessment should precede any field release of synthetic organisms. It suggests support for public engagement, education, and dialogue to ensure public trust and avoid unnecessary limitations on science and social progress.",

Setaria viridis is a model monocot species with a relatively compact genome that has limited transposable element content. CRISPR-based genome editing approaches were used to create loss-of-function alleles for the two putative functional DRM genes in S. viridis to probe the role of RdDM. Double mutant (drm1ab) plants exhibit some morphological abnormalities but are fully viable. Whole-genome methylation profiling provided evidence for wide-spread loss of methylation in CHH sequence contexts, particularly in regions with high CHH methylation in wild-type plants. Evidence was also found for locus-specific loss of CG and CHG methylation, even in some regions that lack CHH methylation. Transcriptome profiling identified genes with altered expression in the drm1ab mutants. However, the majority of genes with high levels ofCHH methylation directly surrounding the transcription start site or in nearby promoter regions in wild-type plants do not have altered expression in the drm1ab mutant even when this methylation is lost, suggesting limited regulation of gene expression by RdDM. Detailed analysis of the expression of transposable elements identified several transposons that are transcriptionally activated in drm1ab mutants. These transposons likely require active RdDM for maintenance of transcriptional repression.",

author = "Johnson, R A and Hellens, R P and Love, D R",
abstract = "Replacement of endogenous genes by homologous recombination is rare in plants; the majority of genetic modifications are the result of transforming DNA molecules undergoing random genomic insertion by way of non-homologous recombination. Factors that affect chromatin remodeling and DNA repair are thought to have the potential to enhance the frequency of homologous recombination in plants. Conventional tools to study the frequencies of genetic recombination often rely on stable transformation-based approaches, with these systems being rarely capable of high-throughput or combinatorial analysis. We developed a series of vectors that use chemiluminescent (LUC and REN) reporter genes to assay the relative frequency of homologous and non-homologous recombination in plants. These transient assay vectors were used to screen 14 candidate genes for their effects on recombination frequencies in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Over-expression of Arabidopsis genes with sequence similarity to SNM1 from yeast and XRCC3 from humans enhanced the frequency of non-homologous recombination when assayed using two different donor vectors. Transient N. benthamiana leaf systems were also used in an alternative assay for preliminary measurements of homologous recombination frequencies, which were found to be enhanced by over-expression of RAD52, MIM and RAD51 from yeast, as well as CHR24 from Arabidopsis. The findings for the assays described here are in line with previous studies that analyzed recombination frequencies using stable transformation. The assays we report have revealed functions in non-homologous recombination for the Arabidopsis SNM1 and XRCC3 genes, so the suppression of these genes' expression offers a potential means to enhance the gene targeting frequency in plants. Furthermore, our findings also indicate that plant gene targeting frequencies could be enhanced by over-expression of RAD52, MIM, CHR24, and RAD51 genes.",

Here we explore new advances in our understanding of how TCR complexes assemble through cooperative interactions between repair factors stimulated by RNAPII ubiquitylation. Mounting evidence suggests that RNAPII ubiquitylation activates TCR complex assembly during repair and, in parallel, promotes processing and degradation of RNAPII to prevent prolonged stalling. The fate of stalled RNAPII is therefore emerging as a crucial link between TCR and associated human diseases.",

T-strands may subsequently randomly integrate into plant chromosomes and permanently express encoded transgenes, a process known as stable transformation. The molecular processes by which T-strands integrate into the host genome remain unknown. Although integration resembles DNA repair processes, the requirement of known DNA repair pathways for integration is controversial. The configuration and genomic position of integrated T-DNA molecules likely affect transgene expression, and control of integration is consequently important for basic research and agricultural biotechnology applications. This article reviews our current knowledge of the process of T-DNA integration and proposes ways in which this knowledge may be manipulated for genome editing and synthetic biology purposes.",

Complexity is often driven by gene duplication, which allows paralogs to specialize in an activity of the ancestral gene or acquire novel functions. Angiosperms encode a variety of gene silencing pathways that share related machinery for small RNA biosynthesis and function. Recent phylogenetic analysis of these gene families plots the expansion, specialization, and occasional contraction of this core machinery. This analysis reveals the ancient origin of RNA-directed DNA Methylation in early land plants, or possibly their algal ancestors, as well as ongoing duplications that evolve novel small RNA pathways.",

We synthesized and delivered variant rat HoxA clusters (130 to 170 kilobases) to an ectopic location in the mouse genome. We found that a minimal HoxA cluster recapitulated correct patterns of chromatin remodeling and transcription in response to patterning signals, whereas the addition of distal enhancers was needed for full transcriptional output.

Target recognition strictly requires the presence of a short protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) flanking the target site, and subsequent R-loop formation and strand scission are driven by complementary base pairing between the guide RNA and target DNA, Cas9-DNA interactions, and associated conformational changes. The use of CRISPR-Cas9 as an RNA-programmable DNA targeting and editing platform is simplified by a synthetic single-guide RNA (sgRNA) mimicking the natural dual trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA)-CRISPR RNA (crRNA) structure. This review aims to provide an in-depth mechanistic and structural understanding of Cas9-mediated RNA-guided DNA targeting and cleavage.

To determine the genetic basis of SSTR in human cells, we developed a coupled inhibition-cutting system capable of interrogating multiple editing outcomes in the context of thousands of individual gene knockdowns. We found that human Cas9-induced SSTR requires the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, which is normally implicated in interstrand cross-link repair. The FA pathway does not directly impact error-prone, non-homologous end joining, but instead diverts repair toward SSTR. Furthermore, FANCD2 protein localizes to Cas9-induced DSBs, indicating a direct role in regulating genome editing. Since FA is itself a genetic disease, these data imply that patient genotype and/or transcriptome may impact the effectiveness of gene editing treatments and that treatments biased toward FA repair pathways could have therapeutic value. A coupled knockdown-editing screen shows that CRISPR--Cas9 editing in human cells requires the Fanconi anemia pathway, which acts by diverting double-strand break repair away from non-homologous end joining toward single-strand template repair.",

In Arabidopsis, 18 HDAC genes are divided into three different types - RPD3-like, HD-tuin and sirtuin - with two or more members in each type. The structural feature of each HDAC class, the expression profile of each HDAC gene during development and functional insights of important family members are summarized here.

abstract = "Plants are inescapably exposed to environmental stress because of their sessile lifestyle. Such stress induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are in turn a source of genotoxic stress. ROS are also generated intrinsically during photosynthesis in the chloroplasts. Furthermore, plants are affected by the UV component of sunlight, which damages their genomes. To protect their genomic integrity from DNA damage, plants activate a DNA damage response (DDR) system that regulates cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and programmed cell death. Although plants have orthologs of several of the DDR factors that are found in animals, certain critical animal DDR factors, notably the tumor suppressor p53 and the DDR kinases CHK1 and CHK2, have not been found in plants. In this mini-review, we summarize the functions and regulatory mechanism of Arabidopsis thaliana SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE 1 (SOG1), a plant-specific transcription factor that plays a central role in the DDR. The characteristics of SOG1 are similar to those of animal p53, even though the proteins' amino acid sequences are unrelated. We suggest that plants acquired the central transcriptional factor SOG1 as a functional homolog of p53 during the evolution of their DDR system.",

However, these methods are generally inefficient, heavily genotype dependent, and low throughput. Among the alternative plant transformation approaches, the protoplast-based transformation holds the potential to directly deliver DNA, RNA, or protein molecules into plant cells in an efficient and high-throughput manner. Here, we presented a robust and simplified protocol for protoplast-based DNA/ribonucleoproteinRibonucleoprotein (RNP)(RNPRibonucleoprotein (RNP))-mediated genome editingGenome editing in the model species Nicotiana benthamiana. Using this protocol, we have achieved the gene editing efficiency at 30--60\% in protoplasts and 50--80\% in regenerated calli and plants. The edited protoplasts can be readily regenerated without selection agents owing to highly efficient DNA or preassembled RNPRibonucleoprotein (RNP)transformation frequency. Lastly, this protocol utilized an improved culture media regime to overcome the complex media composition used in the previous studies.

To obtain more insight in the level of clonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and during treatment, we used single-cell targeted DNA sequencing with the Tapestri platform. We designed a custom ALL panel and obtained accurate single-nucleotide variant and small insertion-deletion mutation calling for 305 amplicons covering 110 genes in about 4400 cells per sample and time point. A total of 108 188 cells were analyzed for 25 samples of 8 T-ALL patients. We typically observed a major clone at diagnosis (>35\% of the cells) accompanied by several minor clones of which some were less than 1\% of the total number of cells. Four patients had >2 NOTCH1 mutations, some of which present in minor clones, indicating a strong pressure to acquire NOTCH1 mutations in developing T-ALL cells. By analyzing longitudinal samples, we detected the presence and clonal nature of residual leukemic cells and clones with a minor presence at diagnosis that evolved to clinically relevant major clones at later disease stages. Therefore, single-cell DNA amplicon sequencing is a sensitive assay to detect clonal architecture and evolution in T-ALL.",

In this study, we show that chromatin open status is a pivotal determinant of the Cas9 editing activity in mammalian cells, and increasing chromatin accessibility can efficiently improve Cas9 genome editing. However, the strategy that increases chromatin openness by fusing the VP64 transcriptional activation domain at the C-terminus of Cas9 can only promote genome editing activity slightly at most tested CRISPR-Cas9 targets in Lenti-X 293T cells. Under the enlightenment that histone acetylation increases eukaryotic chromatin accessibility, we developed a composite strategy to further improve genome editing by activating histone acetylation. We demonstrate that promoting histone acetylation using the histone acetyltransferase activator YF-2 can improve the genome editing by Cas9 and, more robustly, by the Cas9 transcriptional activator (Cas9-AD). This strategy holds great potential to enhance CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and to enable broader CRISPR gRNA target choices for experiments in eukaryotes.",

abstract = "Summary Targeted therapy and immunotherapy have revolutionized cancer treatment. However, the ability of cancer to evade the immune system remains a major barrier for effective treatment. Related to this, several targeted DNA-damage response inhibitors (DDRis) are being tested in the clinic and have been shown to potentiate anti-tumor immune responses. Seminal studies have shown that these agents are highly effective in a pan-cancer class of tumors with genetic defects in key DNA repair genes such as BRCA1/2, BRCA-related genes, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), and others. Here, we review the molecular consequences of targeted DDR inhibition, from tumor cell death to increased engagement of the anti-tumor immune response. Additionally, we discuss mechanistic and clinical rationale for pairing targeted DDRis with immunotherapy for enhanced tumor control. We also review biomarkers for patient selection and promising new immunotherapy approaches poised to form the foundation of next-generation DDRi and immunotherapy combinations.",

abstract = "The transposases of DNA transposable elements catalyze the excision of the element from the host genome, but are not involved in the repair of the resulting double-strand break. To elucidate the role of various host DNA repair and damage response proteins in the repair of the hairpin-ended double strand breaks (DSBs) generated during excision of the maize Ac element in Arabidopsis thaliana, we deep-sequenced hundreds of thousands of somatic excision products from a variety of repair- or response-defective mutants. We find that each of these repair/response defects negatively affects the preservation of the ends, resulting in an enhanced frequency of deletions, insertions, and inversions at the excision site. The spectra of the resulting repair products demonstrate, not unexpectedly, that the canonical nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) proteins DNA ligase IV and KU70 play an important role in the repair of the lesion generated by Ac excision. Our data also indicate that auxiliary NHEJ repair proteins such as DNA ligase VI and DNA polymerase lambda are routinely involved in the repair of these lesions. Roles for the damage response kinases ATM and ATR in the repair of transposition-induced DSBs are also discussed.",

abstract = "Differences in the substrate specificity of mammalian family X DNA polymerases are proposed to partly depend on a loop (loop 1) upstream of the polymerase active site. To examine if this is the case in DNA polymerase $\lambda$ (pol $\lambda$), here we characterize a variant of the human polymerase in which nine residues of loop 1 are replaced with four residues from the equivalent position in pol $\beta$. Crystal structures of the mutant enzyme bound to gapped DNA with and without a correct dNTP reveal that the change in loop 1 does not affect the overall structure of the protein. Consistent with these structural data, the mutant enzyme has relatively normal catalytic efficiency for correct incorporation, and it efficiently participates in non-homologous end joining of double-strand DNA breaks. However, DNA junctions recovered from end-joining reactions are more diverse than normal, and the mutant enzyme is substantially less accurate than wild-type pol $\lambda$ in three different biochemical assays. Comparisons of the binary and ternary complex crystal structures of mutant and wild-type pol $\lambda$ suggest that loop 1 modulates pol $\lambda$'s fidelity by controlling dNTP-induced movements of the template strand and the primer-terminal 3'-OH as the enzyme transitions from an inactive to an active conformation.",

DSBs are considered one of the most deleterious forms of DNA damage and must be quickly recognized and repaired. Telomeres, on the other hand, are specialized, stable DNA ends that must be protected from recognition as DSBs to inhibit unwanted chromosome fusions. Decisions to join DNA ends, or not, are therefore critical to genome stability. Yet, the processing of telomeres and DSBs share many commonalities. Accordingly, key decision points are used to shift DNA ends toward DSB repair vs. end protection. Additionally, DSBs can be repaired by two major pathways, namely homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The choice of which repair pathway is employed is also dictated by a series of decision points that shift the break toward HR or NHEJ. In this review, we will focus on these decision points and the mechanisms that dictate end protection vs. DSB repair and DSB repair choice.",

Despite recent advances in the mechanism studies on spCas9-sgRNA-mediated double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) recognition and cleavage, it is still unclear how the catalytic Mg2+ ions induce the conformation changes toward the catalytic active state. It also remains controversial whether Cas9 generates blunt-ended or staggered-ended breaks with overhangs in the DNA. To investigate these issues, here we performed the first all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the spCas9-sgRNA-dsDNA system with and without Mg2+ bound. The simulation results showed that binding of two Mg2+ ions at the RuvC domain active site could lead to structurally and energetically favorable coordination ready for the non-target DNA strand cleavage. Importantly, we demonstrated with our simulations that Cas9-catalyzed DNA cleavage produces 1-bp staggered ends rather than generally assumed blunt ends.",

Covalent, targeted labeling, such as with a SNAP-tag, uses synthetic dyes to label specific proteins in vivo for studying processes such as endocytosis or for imaging via super-resolution microscopy. Despite its potential, such chemical tagging has not been used effectively in plants. A major drawback has been the limited knowledge regarding cell wall and membrane permeability of the available synthetic dyes. Of 31 synthetic dyes tested here, 23 were taken up into BY-2 cells, while eight were not. This creates sets of dyes that can serve to measure endocytosis. Three of the dyes that were able to enter the cells, SNAP-tag ligands of diethylaminocoumarin, tetramethylrhodamine, and silicon-rhodamine 647, were used to SNAP-tag $\alpha$-tubulin. Successful tagging was verified by live cell imaging and visualization of microtubule arrays in interphase and during mitosis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings. Fluorescence activation-coupled protein labeling with DRBG-488 was used to observe PIN-FORMED2 (PIN2) endocytosis and delivery to the vacuole as well as preferential delivery of newly synthesized PIN2 to the actively forming cell plate during mitosis. Together, the data demonstrate that specific self-labeling of proteins can be used effectively in plants to study a wide variety of cellular and biological processes.",

All these properties support a role of DNA polymerase lambda in base excision repair. On the other hand, the biochemical properties of the polymerisation activity of DNA polymerase lambda are still largely unknown. Here we give evidence that human DNA polymerase lambda has an intrinsic terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase activity that preferentially adds pyrimidines onto 3'OH ends of DNA oligonucleotides.

The decisions that govern these outcomes are widely viewed as a competition between factors that recognize DNA ends and physically promote association of factors specific to each pathway, commonly known as 'pathway choice'. Here I review recent results in the literature and propose that this decision is better described as a sequential set of binding and end processing events, with non-homologous end joining as the first decision point. Physical association and co-localization of end resection factors with non-homologous end-joining factors suggests that ends are transferred between these complexes, thus the ultimate outcome is not the result of a competition but is more akin to a relay race that is determined by the efficiency of the initial end-joining event and the availability of activated DNA end-processing enzymes.",

abstract = "Protein splicing elements, termed inteins, have been discovered in all the domains of life. Basic research on inteins has led to a greater understanding of how they mediate the protein splicing process. Because inteins are natural protein engineering elements they have been harnessed for use in a number of applications, including protein purification, protein semisynthesis, and in vivo and in vitro protein modifications. This review focuses on the use of inteins in plants. A split-gene technique utilizes inteins to reconstitute the activity of a transgene product with the goal of limiting the spread of transgenes from a genetically modified plant to a weedy relative. Furthermore, merging the intein tag for protein purification with the large protein yields possible with plants has the potential to produce pharmaceutically important proteins. Finally, relevant techniques that may be used in plants in the future are discussed.",

Here, we demonstrate intein trans-splicing in Nicotiana tabacum chloroplasts by using the naturally split Ssp DnaE intein. Trans-splicing occurred whether both intein fragments were encoded in the chloroplast or were separated into the chloroplast and nuclear genomes. A biolistic approach was used to integrate two fusion genes, one encoding aminoglycoside-3-adenyltransferase (aadA) and the first 123 aa of the Ssp DnaE intein (In) and the other encoding 36 C-terminal amino acid residues of the Ssp DnaE intein (Ic) and soluble modified green fluorescent protein (smGFP) into N. tabacum plastids. Expression of these gene fragments in the chloroplast resulted in ligated aadA-smGFP due to In-Ic-mediated trans-splicing. Furthermore, an N-terminal portion of the herbicide resistance gene 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) containing a chloroplast localization signal fused to In (EPSPSn-In) was integrated into the nuclear DNA of N. tabacum by using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. The remaining EPSPS gene fragment (EPSPSc) fused to Ic (Ic-EPSPSc) was integrated into the chloroplast genome by homologous recombination. Western blot analysis of cell extracts from these plants showed a full-length EPSPS, demonstrating that the EPSPSn-In gene product migrated to the chloroplast and underwent trans-splicing. Furthermore, these transgenic plants displayed improved resistance to the herbicide N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine (glyphosate) when compared with wild-type N. tabacum.",

It is capable of catalyzing a protein trans-splicing mechanism to assemble a mature protein from two separate precursors. Therefore, it is a powerful tool for protein modification and engineering. Inteins have not been identified, nor have intein-mediated protein splicing reactions been demonstrated, in plant cells. In this paper, we describe the use of the Ssp DnaE split intein in transgenic plants for reconstitution of a protein trans-splicing reaction. We have synthesized artificial genes that encode for N-terminal half (Int-n) and C-terminal half (Int-c) fragments of Ssp DnaE split intein and divided beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene to encode GUS-n and GUS-c parts of the enzyme as reporter. The in-frame fusions of GUSn/Intn and Intc/GUSc were constructed and transfected into Arabidopsis. We have observed in vivo reassembly of functional beta-glucuronidase when both GUSn/Intn and Intc/GUSc constructs were introduced into the same Arabidopsis genome either by cotransformation or through genetic crossing, hereby signifying an intein-mediated protein trans-splicing mechanism reconstituted in plant cells.",

Cas12j-8 is a highly specific nuclease sensitive to single-nucleotide mismatches in the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-proximal region. We experimentally proved that Cas12j-8 enabled allele-specific disruption of genes with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Cas12j-8 recognizes a simple TTN PAM that provides for high target site density. In silico analysis reveals that Cas12j-8 enables allele-specific disruption of 25,931 clinically relevant variants in the ClinVar database, and 485,130,147 SNPs in the dbSNP database.

In vertebrates, these breaks are predominantly repaired by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), which pairs DNA ends in a multiprotein synaptic complex to promote their direct ligation. NHEJ is a highly versatile pathway that uses an array of processing enzymes to modify damaged DNA ends and enable their ligation. The mechanisms of end synapsis and end processing have important implications for genome stability. Rapid and stable synapsis is necessary to limit chromosome translocations that result from the mispairing of DNA ends. Furthermore, end processing must be tightly regulated to minimize mutations at the break site.

The recent demonstration of an intrinsic 5'-deoxyribose-5'-phosphate lyase activity, a template/primer dependent polymerase activity, a distributive manner of DNA synthesis and sequence similarity to DNA polymerase beta suggested a novel beta-like enzyme. All these properties support a role of DNA polymerase lambda in base excision repair. On the other hand, the biochemical properties of the polymerisation activity of DNA polymerase lambda are still largely unknown. Here we give evidence that human DNA polymerase lambda has an intrinsic terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase activity that preferentially adds pyrimidines onto 3'OH ends of DNA oligonucleotides. Furthermore, human DNA polymerase lambda efficiently elongates an RNA primer hybridized to a DNA template. These two novel properties of human DNA polymerase lambda might suggest additional roles for this enzyme in DNA replication and repair processes.",

Even with high efficiency levels of genome editing, phenotypes may be obscured by proportional presence of in-frame mutations that still produce functional protein. Recently, studies in cell culture systems have shown that the nature of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutations can be dependent on local sequence context and can be predicted by computational methods. Here, we demonstrate that similar approaches can be used to forecast CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing outcomes in Xenopus tropicalis, Xenopus laevis, and zebrafish. We show that a publicly available neural network previously trained in mouse embryonic stem cell cultures (InDelphi-mESC) is able to accurately predict CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing outcomes in early vertebrate embryos. Our observations can have direct implications for experiment design, allowing the selection of guide RNAs with predicted repair outcome signatures enriched towards frameshift mutations, allowing maximization of CRISPR/Cas9 phenotype penetrance in the F0 generation.",

If a specific regulation would be regarded necessary, the application of genome editing for crop development may challenge risk assessment and post-market monitoring.

Tall plants bearing many long branches are desired, but only modest success in reaching these goals has been achieved. MicroRNA156 (miR156)-SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) gene modules play pivotal roles in controlling shoot architecture and other traits in crops like rice and wheat. However, the effects of miR156-SPL modules on soya bean architecture and yield, and the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects, remain largely unknown. In this study, we achieved substantial improvements in soya bean architecture and yield by overexpressing GmmiR156b. Transgenic plants produced significantly increased numbers of long branches, nodes and pods, and they exhibited an increased 100-seed weight, resulting in a 46\%-63\% increase in yield per plant. Intriguingly, GmmiR156b overexpression had no significant impact on plant height in a growth room or under field conditions; however, it increased stem thickness significantly. Our data indicate that GmmiR156b modulates these traits mainly via the direct cleavage of SPL transcripts. Moreover, we found that GmSPL9d is expressed in the shoot apical meristem and axillary meristems (AMs) of soya bean, and that GmSPL9d may regulate axillary bud formation and branching by physically interacting with the homeobox gene WUSCHEL (WUS), a central regulator of AM formation. Together, our results identify GmmiR156b as a promising target for the improvement of soya bean plant architecture and yields, and they reveal a new and conserved regulatory cascade involving miR156-SPL-WUS that will help researchers decipher the genetic basis of plant architecture.",

abstract = "Genome editing occurs in the context of chromatin, which is heterogeneous in structure and function across the genome. Chromatin heterogeneity is thought to affect genome editing efficiency, but this has been challenging to quantify due to the presence of confounding variables. Here, we develop a method that exploits the allele-specific chromatin status of imprinted genes in order to address this problem in cycling mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Because maternal and paternal alleles of imprinted genes have identical DNA sequence and are situated in the same nucleus, allele-specific differences in the frequency and spectrum of mutations induced by CRISPR-Cas9 can be unequivocally attributed to epigenetic mechanisms. We found that heterochromatin can impede mutagenesis, but to a degree that depends on other key experimental parameters. Mutagenesis was impeded by up to 7-fold when Cas9 exposure was brief and when intracellular Cas9 expression was low. In contrast, the outcome of mutagenic DNA repair was unaffected by chromatin state, with similar efficiencies of homology-directed repair (HDR) and deletion spectra on maternal and paternal chromosomes. Combined, our data show that heterochromatin imposes a permeable barrier that influences the kinetics, but not the endpoint, of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and suggest that therapeutic applications involving low-level Cas9 exposure will be particularly affected by chromatin status.",

However, cold temperature stimulates the accumulation of reducing sugars in potato tubers. Upon high-temperature processing, these reducing sugars react with free amino acids, resulting in brown, bitter-tasting products and elevated levels of acrylamide--a potential carcinogen. To minimize the accumulation of reducing sugars, RNA interference (RNAi) technology was used to silence the vacuolar invertase gene (VInv), which encodes a protein that breaks down sucrose to glucose and fructose. Because RNAi often results in incomplete gene silencing and requires the plant to be transgenic, here we used transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to knockout VInv within the commercial potato variety, Ranger Russet. We isolated 18 plants containing mutations in at least one VInv allele, and five of these plants had mutations in all VInv alleles. Tubers from full VInv-knockout plants had undetectable levels of reducing sugars, and processed chips contained reduced levels of acrylamide and were lightly coloured. Furthermore, seven of the 18 modified plant lines appeared to contain no TALEN DNA insertions in the potato genome. These results provide a framework for using TALENs to quickly improve traits in commercially relevant autotetraploid potato lines.",

However, plant breeding is currently limited by incremental improvements in quantitative traits that often rely on laborious selection of rare naturally occurring mutations in gene-regulatory regions. Here, we demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of promoters generates diverse cis-regulatory alleles that provide beneficial quantitative variation for breeding. We devised a simple genetic scheme, which exploits trans-generational heritability of Cas9 activity in heterozygous loss-of-function mutant backgrounds, to rapidly evaluate the phenotypic impact of numerous promoter variants for genes regulating three major productivity traits in tomato: fruit size, inflorescence branching, and plant architecture. Our approach allows immediate selection and fixation of novel alleles in transgene-free plants and fine manipulation of yield components. Beyond a platform to enhance variation for diverse agricultural traits, our findings provide a foundation for dissecting complex relationships between gene-regulatory changes and control of quantitative traits.",

Here we describe dimeric RNA-guided FokI nucleases (RFNs) that can recognize extended sequences and edit endogenous genes with high efficiencies in human cells. RFN cleavage activity depends strictly on the binding of two guide RNAs (gRNAs) to DNA with a defined spacing and orientation substantially reducing the likelihood that a suitable target site will occur more than once in the genome and therefore improving specificities relative to wild-type Cas9 monomers. RFNs guided by a single gRNA generally induce lower levels of unwanted mutations than matched monomeric Cas9 nickases. In addition, we describe a simple method for expressing multiple gRNAs bearing any 5' end nucleotide, which gives dimeric RFNs a broad targeting range. RFNs combine the ease of RNA-based targeting with the specificity enhancement inherent to dimerization and are likely to be useful in applications that require highly precise genome editing.",

After low-cost barcode-based deep sequencing, 412 edited sequences covering 118 genes were precisely identified from individuals showing clear phenotypic changes. This mutant profile was similar to the ones identified in human cell lines and predictable. An unexpectedly frequent homology-directed repair through endogenous templates was observed and likely caused by the spatial contact between distinct chromosomes.

abstract = "Current genome-editing technologies introduce double-stranded (ds) DNA breaks at a target locus as the first step to gene correction. Although most genetic diseases arise from point mutations, current approaches to point mutation correction are inefficient and typically induce an abundance of random insertions and deletions (indels) at the target locus resulting from the cellular response to dsDNA breaks. Here we report the development of 'base editing', a new approach to genome editing that enables the direct, irreversible conversion of one target DNA base into another in a programmable manner, without requiring dsDNA backbone cleavage or a donor template. We engineered fusions of CRISPR/Cas9 and a cytidine deaminase enzyme that retain the ability to be programmed with a guide RNA, do not induce dsDNA breaks, and mediate the direct conversion of cytidine to uridine, thereby effecting a C$\rightarrow$T (or G$\rightarrow$A) substitution. The resulting 'base editors' convert cytidines within a window of approximately five nucleotides, and can efficiently correct a variety of point mutations relevant to human disease. In four transformed human and murine cell lines, second- and third-generation base editors that fuse uracil glycosylase inhibitor, and that use a Cas9 nickase targeting the non-edited strand, manipulate the cellular DNA repair response to favour desired base-editing outcomes, resulting in permanent correction of ~15-75\% of total cellular DNA with minimal (typically $\leq$1\%) indel formation. Base editing expands the scope and efficiency of genome editing of point mutations.",

The ability to efficiently convert targeted A•T base pairs to G•C could therefore advance the study and treatment of genetic diseases. The deamination of adenine yields inosine, which is treated as guanine by polymerases, but no enzymes are known to deaminate adenine in DNA. Here we describe adenine base editors (ABEs) that mediate the conversion of A•T to G•C in genomic DNA. We evolved a transfer RNA adenosine deaminase to operate on DNA when fused to a catalytically impaired CRISPR-Cas9 mutant. Extensive directed evolution and protein engineering resulted in seventh-generation ABEs that convert targeted A•T base pairs efficiently to G•C (approximately 50\% efficiency in human cells) with high product purity (typically at least 99.9\%) and low rates of indels (typically no more than 0.1\%). ABEs introduce point mutations more efficiently and cleanly, and with less off-target genome modification, than a current Cas9 nuclease-based method, and can install disease-correcting or disease-suppressing mutations in human cells. Together with previous base editors, ABEs enable the direct, programmable introduction of all four transition mutations without double-stranded DNA cleavage.",

Base editors directly convert one base or base pair into another, enabling the efficient installation of point mutations in non-dividing cells without generating excess undesired editing by-products. In this Review, we summarize base-editing strategies to generate specific and precise point mutations in genomic DNA and RNA, highlight recent developments that expand the scope, specificity, precision and in vivo delivery of base editors and discuss limitations and future directions of base editing for research and therapeutic applications.",

We identify rules for specific targeting of transcriptional repressors (CRISPRi), typically achieving 90\%-99\% knockdown with minimal off-target effects, and activators (CRISPRa) to endogenous genes via endonuclease-deficient Cas9. Together they enable modulation of gene expression over a ∼1,000-fold range. Using these rules, we construct genome-scale CRISPRi and CRISPRa libraries, each of which we validate with two pooled screens. Growth-based screens identify essential genes, tumor suppressors, and regulators of differentiation. Screens for sensitivity to a cholera-diphtheria toxin provide broad insights into the mechanisms of pathogen entry, retrotranslocation and toxicity.

This study selected three genotypes (Williams 82, Shennong 9 and Bert) with high transformation efficiency, which presented better susceptibility to Agrobacterium infection, and three low transformation efficiency genotypes (General, Liaodou 16 and Kottman), which showed a relatively weak susceptibility. Gibberellin (GA) levels and soybean GA20ox2 and CYP707A2 transcripts of high-efficiency genotypes increased and were higher than those of low-efficiency genotypes; however, the opposite performance was shown in abscisic acid (ABA). Higher zeatin riboside (ZR) content and DNA quantity, and relatively higher expression of soybean IPT5, CYCD3 and CYCA3 were obtained in high-efficiency genotypes. High-efficiency genotypes had low methyl jasmonate (MeJA) content, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) activity, and relatively lower expression of soybean OPR3, PPO1 and PRX71. GA and ZR were positive plant factors for Agrobacterium-mediated soybean transformation by facilitating germination and growth, and increasing the number of cells in DNA synthesis cycle, respectively; MeJA, PPO, POD and ABA were negative plant factors by inducing defence reactions and repressing germination and growth, respectively.",

abstract = "Soybean oil is high in polyunsaturated fats and is often partially hydrogenated to increase its shelf life and improve oxidative stability. The trans-fatty acids produced through hydrogenation pose a health threat. Soybean lines that are low in polyunsaturated fats were generated by introducing mutations in two fatty acid desaturase 2 genes (FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B), which in the seed convert the monounsaturated fat, oleic acid, to the polyunsaturated fat, linoleic acid. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) were engineered to recognize and cleave conserved DNA sequences in both genes. In four of 19 transgenic soybean lines expressing the TALENs, mutations in FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B were observed in DNA extracted from leaf tissue; three of the four lines transmitted heritable FAD2-1 mutations to the next generation. The fatty acid profile of the seed was dramatically changed in plants homozygous for mutations in both FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B: oleic acid increased from 20\% to 80\% and linoleic acid decreased from 50\% to under 4\%. Further, mutant plants were identified that lacked the TALEN transgene and only carried the targeted mutations. The ability to create a valuable trait in a single generation through targeted modification of a gene family demonstrates the power of TALENs for genome engineering and crop improvement.",

Explants were bombarded with recombinant plasmids engineered for the expression of cryIAc transgene in plants and stable transformants regenerated in presence of benzyladenine, kinetin and kanamycin. Transformation frequency showed dependence on explant type, cultivars, plasmids, helium pressure and microcarrier type used. Integration of transgenes was demonstrated using polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot hybridization approaches in T (0) plants. The expression of CryIA(c) delta-endotoxin and GUS enzyme was ascertained by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and histochemical assays, respectively. These transgenic plants (T (0)) showed more protection and high mortality for Heliothis armigera and Spodoptera litura larvae as compared to control plants. The results of the present study indicate that highest transformation frequency (18\%) could be achieved by use of gold as a microcarrier in combination with helium pressure of 900 psi. Among the other factors tested, plasmid pHS 102 was the most efficient plasmid, while epicotyl explant was the best explant source for particle gun bombardment.

Nanoparticles are promising materials for biomolecule delivery, owing to their ability to traverse plant cell walls without external force and highly tunable physicochemical properties for diverse cargo conjugation and broad host range applicability.

abstract = "Constitutive expression of the Zea mays L. (maize) morphogenic transcription factors Baby Boom (Bbm) and Wuschel2 (Wus2) in maize can not only greatly increase transformation efficiency but can also induce phenotypic abnormalities and sterility. In an effort to alleviate the pleiotropic effects of constitutive expression, a genome wide search was undertaken to find suitable maize promoters to drive tissue and timing-specific expression of the transformation enhancing genes Bbm and Wus2. A promoter from a maize phospholipid transferase protein gene (Zm-PLTPpro) was identified based on its expression in leaves, embryos, and callus while being downregulated in roots, meristems, and reproductive tissues. When Zm-PLTPprodriving Bbm was transformed into immature maize embryos along with a Wus2 expression cassette driven by the nopaline synthase promoter (Nospro::Wus2) abundant somatic embryos rapidly formed on the scutella. These embryos were individual and uniformly transformed and could be directly germinated into plants without a callus phase. Transformed plants could be sent to the greenhouse in as little as 1 mo and regenerated plants matched the seed-derived phenotype for the inbred and were fertile. However, T1 seed from these plants had poor germination. Replacing Nosprowith a maize auxin-inducible promoter (Zm-Axig1pro) in combination with Zm-PLTPpro::Bbm, allowed healthy, fertile plants to be regenerated. Single-copy T1 seed germinated normally and had a predominantly wild-type inbred phenotype. For maize, this callus-free transformation process has worked in all inbred lines tested.",

Transient presence of RNP molecules in cells can reduce undesirable off-target effects. One method for RNP delivery into plant cells is the use of a biolistic gun. To facilitate selection of transformed cells during RNP delivery, a plasmid carrying a selectable marker gene can be co-delivered with the RNP to enrich for transformed/edited cells. In this work, we compare targeted mutagenesis in rice using three different delivery platforms: biolistic RNP/DNA co-delivery; biolistic DNA delivery; and Agrobacterium-mediated delivery. All three platforms were successful in generating desired mutations at the target sites. However, we observed a high frequency (over 14\%) of random plasmid or chromosomal DNA fragment insertion at the target sites in transgenic events generated from both biolistic delivery platforms. In contrast, integration of random DNA fragments was not observed in transgenic events generated from the Agrobacterium-mediated method. These data reveal important insights that must be considered when selecting the method for genome-editing reagent delivery in plants, and emphasize the importance of employing appropriate molecular screening methods to detect unintended alterations following genome engineering.",

abstract = "KEY MESSAGE: Discriminatory co-expression of maize BBM and WUS transcriptional factor genes promoted somatic embryogenesis and efficient Agrobacterium -mediated transformation of recalcitrant maize inbred B73 and sorghum P898012 genotypes without use of a selectable marker gene. The use of morphogenic regulators to overcome barriers in plant transformation is a revolutionary breakthrough for basic plant science and crop applications. Current standard plant transformation systems are bottlenecks for genetic, genomic, and crop improvement studies. We investigated the differential use of co-expression of maize transcription factors BABY BOOM and WUSCHEL2 coupled with a desiccation inducible CRE/lox excision system to enable regeneration of stable transgenic recalcitrant maize inbred B73 and sorghum P898012 without a chemical selectable marker. The PHP78891 expression cassette contains CRE driven by the drought inducible maize RAB17M promoter with lox P sites which bracket the CRE, WUS, and BBM genes. A constitutive maize UBI M promoter directs a ZsGreen GFP expression cassette as a reporter outside of the excision sites and provides transient, transgenic, and developmental analysis. This was coupled with evidence for molecular integration and analysis of stable integration and desiccation inducible CRE-mediated excision. Agrobacterium-mediated transgenic introduction of this vector showed transient expression of GFP and induced somatic embryogenesis in maize B73 and sorghum P898012 explants. Subjection to desiccation stress in tissue culture enabled the excision of CRE, WUS, and BBM, leaving the UBI M::GFP cassette and allowing subsequent plant regeneration and GFP expression analysis. Stable GFP expression was observed in the early and late somatic embryos, young shoots, vegetative plant organs, and pollen. Transgene integration and expression of GFP positive T0 plants were also analyzed using PCR and Southern blots. Progeny segregation analysis of primary events confirmed correlation between functional GFP expression and presence of the GFP transgene in T1 plants generated from self pollinations, indicating good transgene inheritance. This study confirms and extends the use of morphogenic regulators to overcome transformation barriers.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Soybean is subjected to genetic manipulation by breeding, mutation, and transgenic approaches to produce value-added quality traits. Among those genetic approaches, mutagenesis through fast neutrons radiation is intriguing because it yields a variety of mutations, including single/multiple gene deletions and/or duplications. Characterizing the seed composition of the fast neutron mutants and its relationship with gene mutation is useful towards understanding oil and protein traits in soybean. RESULTS: From a large population of fast neutron mutagenized plants, we selected ten mutants based on a screening of total oil and protein content using near infra-red spectroscopy. These ten mutants were regrown, and the seeds were analyzed for oil by GC-MS, protein profiling by SDS-PAGE and gene mapping by comparative genomic hybridization. The mutant 2R29C14Cladecr233cMN15 (nicknamed in this study as L10) showed higher protein and lower oil content compared to the wild type, followed by three other lines (nicknamed in this study as L03, L05, and L06). We characterized the fatty acid methyl esters profile of the trans-esterified oil and found the presence of five major fatty acids (palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids) at varying proportions among the mutants. Protein profile using SDS-PAGE of the ten mutants did exhibit discernable variation between storage (glycinin and $\beta$-conglycinin) and anti-nutritional factor (trypsin inhibitor) proteins. In addition, we physically mapped the position of the gene deletions or duplications in each mutant using comparative genomic hybridization. CONCLUSION: Characterization of oil and protein profile in soybean fast neutron mutants will assist scientist and breeders to develop new value-added soybeans with improved protein and oil quality traits.",

To minimize off-target cleavage, we further describe a double-nicking strategy using the Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs. This protocol provides experimentally derived guidelines for the selection of target sites, evaluation of cleavage efficiency and analysis of off-target activity.

Using a multiplexed reporter assay in combination with Cas9 cutting, we systematically measure the relative activities of three DSB repair pathways as a function of chromatin context in >1,000 genomic locations. This reveals that non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is broadly biased toward euchromatin, while the contribution of microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) is higher in specific heterochromatin contexts. In H3K27me3-marked heterochromatin, inhibition of the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 reverts the balance toward NHEJ. Single-stranded template repair (SSTR), often used for precise CRISPR editing, competes with MMEJ and is moderately linked to chromatin context.

An unusually large number of splice variants is observed for the pol mu gene, most of which affect the polymerase domain. Expression of mRNA of both polymerases is down-regulated upon treatment by DNA damaging agents (UV light, gamma-rays or H(2)O(2)).

The predicted Pol beta2 protein contains a BRCT motif in its NH(2)-terminal region; its COOH-terminal region exhibits 33\% sequence identity to a corresponding region of human Pol beta. The Pol beta2 gene is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with transcripts being most abundant in testis. A fusion construct comprising Pol beta2 and green fluorescent protein exhibited a predominantly nuclear localization in transfected HeLa cells. Recombinant human Pol beta2 from insect cells exhibited substantial DNA polymerase activity, but it did not possess terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase activity. A truncated Pol beta2 mutant lacking the BRCT motif retained substantial DNA polymerase activity, whereas a mutant Pol beta2 with two alanine point mutations within the DNA polymerase active site did not.

Two hormone systems that universally control flowering and plant architecture, florigen and gibberellin, were the source of multiple revolutions that modified reproductive transitions and proportional growth among plant parts. Although step changes based on serendipitous mutations in these hormone systems laid the foundation, genetic and agronomic tuning were required for broad agricultural benefits. We propose that generating targeted genetic variation in core components of both systems would elicit a wider range of phenotypic variation.

Predominant insertions of a gRNA-specific nucleotide are consistent with template-dependent repair of staggered DNA ends with 1-bp 5' overhangs. We confirm that such staggered ends are induced by Cas9 in mouse pre-B cells. To explain observed insertions, we propose a model generating primarily blunt and occasionally staggered DNA ends.

The survey consolidates a body of literature that suggests that the type (insertion, deletion, and complex) and the approximate length of indel edits can be somewhat customized with different GEENs and by manipulating the expression of key NHEJ genes. Structural data suggest that binding of GEENs to DNA may interfere with binding of key components of DNA repair complexes, favoring either classical- or alternative-NHEJ. The hypotheses have some limitations, but if validated, will enable scientists to better control indel makeup, holding promise for basic science and clinical applications of gene editing.

abstract = "The rapid development of the CRISPR-Cas9, -Cas12a and -Cas12b genome editing systems has greatly fuelled basic and translational plant research1-6.

The PAM requirement for the most popular Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) is NGG (N = A, T, C, G)7, limiting its targeting scope to GC-rich regions. Here, we demonstrate genome editing at relaxed PAM sites in rice (a monocot) and the Dahurian larch (a coniferous tree), using an engineered SpRY Cas9 variant8. Highly efficient targeted mutagenesis can be readily achieved by SpRY at relaxed PAM sites in the Dahurian larch protoplasts and in rice transgenic lines through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Furthermore, an SpRY-based cytosine base editor was developed and demonstrated by directed evolution of new herbicide resistant OsALS alleles in rice. Similarly, a highly active SpRY adenine base editor was developed based on ABE8e (ref. 9) and SpRY-ABE8e was able to target relaxed PAM sites in rice plants, achieving up to 79\% editing efficiency with high product purity. Thus, the SpRY toolbox breaks a PAM restriction barrier in plant genome engineering by enabling DNA editing in a PAM-less fashion. Evidence was also provided for secondary off-target effects by de novo generated single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) due to SpRY-mediated transfer DNA self-editing, which calls for more sophisticated programmes for designing highly specific sgRNAs when implementing the SpRY genome editing toolbox.",

Here, we report that engineered Cas9 nucleases that create different DNA break structures engage competing repair pathways at dramatically altered frequencies. We accordingly designed a Cas9 variant (vCas9) that produces breaks which suppress otherwise dominant nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair. Instead, breaks created by vCas9 are predominantly repaired by pathways utilizing homologous sequences, specifically microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR). Consequently, vCas9 enables efficient precise editing through HDR or MMEJ while suppressing indels caused by NHEJ in dividing and nondividing cells.

The inability of TdT to accommodate a template strand can be explained by steric hindrance at the catalytic site caused by a long lariat-like loop, which is absent in DNA polymerase beta. However, displacement of this discriminating loop would be sufficient to unmask a number of evolutionarily conserved residues, which could then interact with a template DNA strand. The present structure can be used to model the recently discovered human polymerase mu, with which it shares 43\% sequence identity.",

Eukaryotes retain at least three replicative B-family DNA polymerases, DNA polymerase $\alpha$, $\delta$, and $\epsilon$, and one translesion B-family DNA polymerase, DNA polymerase $\zeta$. Here, we present molecular evolutionary evidence that suggests DNA polymerase genes evolved through horizontal gene transfer between the viral and archaeal-eukaryotic lineages. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the B-family DNA polymerases from nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs), eukaryotes, and archaea suggest that different NCLDV lineages such as Poxviridae and Mimiviridae were involved in the evolution of different DNA polymerases (pol-$\alpha$-, $\delta$-, $\epsilon$-, and $\zeta$-like genes) in archaeal-eukaryotic cell lineages, putatively through horizontal gene transfer.

abstract = "Prime editing (PE) is a precision gene editing technology that enables the programmable installation of substitutions, insertions and deletions in cells and animals without requiring double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). The mechanism of PE makes it less dependent on cellular replication and endogenous DNA repair than homology-directed repair-based approaches, and its ability to precisely install edits without creating DSBs minimizes indels and other undesired outcomes. The capabilities of PE have also expanded since its original publication. Enhanced PE systems, PE4 and PE5, manipulate DNA repair pathways to increase PE efficiency and reduce indels. Other advances that improve PE efficiency include engineered pegRNAs (epegRNAs), which include a structured RNA motif to stabilize and protect pegRNA 3' ends, and the PEmax architecture, which improves editor expression and nuclear localization. New applications such as twin PE (twinPE) can precisely insert or delete hundreds of base pairs of DNA and can be used in tandem with recombinases to achieve gene-sized (>5 kb) insertions and inversions. Achieving optimal PE requires careful experimental design, and the large number of parameters that influence PE outcomes can be daunting. This protocol describes current best practices for conducting PE and twinPE experiments and describes the design and optimization of pegRNAs. We also offer guidelines for how to select the proper PE system (PE1 to PE5 and twinPE) for a given application. Finally, we provide detailed instructions on how to perform PE in mammalian cells. Compared with other procedures for editing human cells, PE offers greater precision and versatility, and can be completed within 2-4 weeks.",

abstract = "Harnessing CRISPR-Cas9 technology provides an unprecedented ability to modify genomic loci via DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction and repair. We analyzed nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair induced by Cas9 in budding yeast and found that the orientation of binding of Cas9 and its guide RNA (gRNA) profoundly influences the pattern of insertion/deletions (indels) at the site of cleavage. A common indel created by Cas9 is a 1-bp (+1) insertion that appears to result from Cas9 creating a 1-nt 5' overhang that is filled in by a DNA polymerase and ligated. The origin of +1 insertions was investigated by using two gRNAs with PAM sequences located on opposite DNA strands but designed to cleave the same sequence. These templated +1 insertions are dependent on the X-family DNA polymerase, Pol4. Deleting Pol4 also eliminated +2 and +3 insertions, which are biased toward homonucleotide insertions. Using inverted PAM sequences, we also found significant differences in overall NHEJ efficiency and repair profiles, suggesting that the binding of the Cas9:gRNA complex influences subsequent NHEJ processing. As with events induced by the site-specific HO endonuclease, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated NHEJ repair depends on the Ku heterodimer and DNA ligase 4. Cas9 events are highly dependent on the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex, independent of Mre11's nuclease activity. Inspection of the outcomes of a large number of Cas9 cleavage events in mammalian cells reveals a similar templated origin of +1 insertions in human cells, but also a significant frequency of similarly templated +2 insertions.",

Integrative analysis indicates that these 12 chromatin marks, which collectively cover ∼90\% of the genome, are present at any given position in a very limited number of combinations. Moreover, we show that the distribution of the 12 marks along the genomic sequence defines four main chromatin states, which preferentially index active genes, repressed genes, silent repeat elements and intergenic regions. Given the compact nature of the Arabidopsis genome, these four indexing states typically translate into short chromatin domains interspersed with each other. This first combinatorial view of the Arabidopsis epigenome points to simple principles of organization as in metazoans and provides a framework for further studies of chromatin-based regulatory mechanisms in plants.",

We target the integrated reporters (IRs) using RNA-guided Cas9 and characterize induced mutations by sequencing. We report that gRNA-sequence and IR locus explain most variation in mutation efficiency. Predominant insertions of a gRNA-specific nucleotide are consistent with template-dependent repair of staggered DNA ends with 1-bp 5' overhangs. We confirm that such staggered ends are induced by Cas9 in mouse pre-B cells. To explain observed insertions, we propose a model generating primarily blunt and occasionally staggered DNA ends.

Here, we show that most asymmetric methylation is facilitated by DDM1 and mediated by the methyltransferase CMT2 separately from RdDM. We find that heterochromatic sequences preferentially require DDM1 for DNA methylation and that this preference depends on linker histone H1. RdDM is instead inhibited by heterochromatin and absolutely requires the nucleosome remodeler DRD1. Together, DDM1 and RdDM mediate nearly all transposon methylation and collaborate to repress transposition and regulate the methylation and expression of genes.

Helling, and I reported in PNAS that individual genes can be cloned and isolated by enzymatically cleaving DNA molecules into fragments, linking the fragments to an autonomously replicating plasmid, and introducing the resulting recombinant DNA molecules into bacteria. A few months later, Chang and I reported that genes from unrelated bacterial species can be combined and propagated using the same approach and that interspecies recombinant DNA molecules can produce a biologically functional protein in a foreign host. Soon afterward, Boyer's laboratory and mine published our collaborative discovery that even genes from animal cells can be cloned in bacteria. These three PNAS papers quickly led to the use of DNA cloning methods in multiple areas of the biological and chemical sciences.

The fundamental ability of DNA polymerases to synthesize a deoxyribonucleotide chain is conserved. However, the more specific properties, including processivity, fidelity (synthesis accuracy), and substrate nucleotide selectivity, differ among the enzymes. The distinctive properties of each DNA polymerase may lead to the potential development of unique reagents, and therefore searching for novel DNA polymerase has been one of the major focuses in this research field. In addition, protein engineering techniques to create mutant or artificial DNA polymerases have been successfully developing powerful DNA polymerases, suitable for specific purposes among the many kinds of DNA manipulations.

The process of integration is thought to involve invasion and ligation of T-DNA, or its copying, into nicks or breaks in the host genome. Integrated T-DNA often contains, at its junctions with plant DNA, deletions of T-DNA or plant DNA, filler DNA, and/or microhomology between T-DNA and plant DNA pre-integration sites. T-DNA integration is also often associated with major plant genome rearrangements, including inversions and translocations. These characteristics are similar to those often found after repair of DNA breaks, and thus DNA repair mechanisms have frequently been invoked to explain the mechanism of T-DNA integration. However, the involvement of specific plant DNA repair proteins and Agrobacterium proteins in integration remains controversial, with numerous contradictory results reported in the literature. In this review I discuss this literature and comment on many of these studies. I conclude that either multiple known DNA repair pathways can be used for integration, or that some yet unknown pathway must exist to facilitate T-DNA integration into the plant genome.",

abstract = "Delivery of genome editing reagents using CRISPR-Cas ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) transfection offers several advantages over plasmid DNA-based delivery methods, including reduced off-target editing effects, mitigation of random integration of non-native DNA fragments, independence of vector constructions, and less regulatory restrictions. Compared to the use in animal systems, RNP-mediated genome editing is still at the early development stage in plants. In this study, we established an efficient and simplified protoplast-based genome editing platform for CRISPR-Cas RNP delivery, and then evaluated the efficiency, specificity, and temperature sensitivity of six Cas9 and Cas12a proteins. Our results demonstrated that Cas9 and Cas12a RNP delivery resulted in genome editing frequencies (8.7--41.2\%) at various temperature conditions, 22°C, 26°C, and 37°C, with no significant temperature sensitivity. LbCas12a often exhibited the highest activities, while AsCas12a demonstrated higher sequence specificity. The high activities of CRISPR-Cas RNPs at 22° and 26°C, the temperature preferred by plant transformation and tissue culture, led to high mutagenesis efficiencies (34.0--85.2\%) in the protoplast-regenerated calli and plants with the heritable mutants recovered in the next generation. This RNP delivery approach was further extended to pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), soybean (Glycine max) and Setaria viridis with up to 70.2\% mutagenesis frequency. Together, this study sheds light on the choice of RNP reagents to achieve efficient transgene-free genome editing in plants.",

abstract = "In recent years, Setaria viridis has been developed as a model plant to better understand the C4 photosynthetic pathway in major crops. With the increasing availability of genomic resources for S. viridis research, highly efficient genome editing technologies are needed to create genetic variation resources for functional genomics. Here, we developed a protoplast assay to rapidly optimize the multiplexed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas9) system in S. viridis. Targeted mutagenesis efficiency was further improved by an average of 1.4-fold with the exonuclease, Trex2. Distinctive mutation profiles were found in the Cas9\_Trex2 samples, with 94\% of deletions larger than 10 bp, and essentially no insertions at all tested target sites. Further analyses indicated that 52.2\% of deletions induced by Cas9\_Trex2, as opposed to 3.5\% by Cas9 alone, were repaired through microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) rather than the canonical non-homologous end joining DNA repair pathway. Combined with a robust Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method with more than 90\% efficiency, the multiplex CRISPR/Cas9\_Trex2 system was demonstrated to induce targeted mutations in two tightly linked genes, svDrm1a and svDrm1b, at a frequency ranging from 73\% to 100\% in T0 plants. These mutations were transmitted to at least 60\% of the transgene-free T1 plants, with 33\% of them containing bi-allelic or homozygous mutations in both genes. This highly efficient multiplex CRISPR/Cas9\_Trex2 system makes it possible to create a large mutant resource for S. viridis in a rapid and high throughput manner, and has the potential to be widely applicable in achieving more predictable and deletion-only MMEJ-mediated mutations in many plant species.",

abstract = "Genome editing by RNA-guided nucleases, such as SpCas9, has been used in numerous different plant species. However, to what extent multiple independent loci can be targeted simultaneously by multiplexing has not been well documented. Here, we developed a toolkit, based on a highly intron-optimized zCas9i gene, which allows assembly of nuclease constructs expressing up to 32 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). We used this toolkit to explore the limits of multiplexing in two major model species, and report on the isolation of transgene-free octuple (8$\times$) Nicotiana benthamiana and duodecuple (12$\times$) Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lines in a single generation (T1 and T2 , respectively). We developed novel counter-selection markers for N. benthamiana, most importantly Sl-FAST2, comparable to the well-established Arabidopsis seed fluorescence marker, and FCY-UPP, based on the production of toxic 5-fluorouracil in the presence of a precursor. Targeting eight genes with an array of nine different sgRNAs and relying on FCY-UPP for selection of non-transgenic T1 , we identified N. benthamiana mutant lines with astonishingly high efficiencies: All analyzed plants carried mutations in all genes (approximately 112/116 target sites edited). Furthermore, we targeted 12 genes by an array of 24 sgRNAs in A. thaliana. Efficiency was significantly lower in A. thaliana, and our results indicate Cas9 availability is the limiting factor in such higher-order multiplexing applications. We identified a duodecuple mutant line by a combination of phenotypic screening and amplicon sequencing. The resources and results presented provide new perspectives for how multiplexing can be used to generate complex genotypes or to functionally interrogate groups of candidate genes.",

To this end, we developed a novel vector system for chloroplast transformation with acetolactate synthase (ALS). ALS catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of the branched amino acids, and its enzymatic activity is inhibited by certain classes of herbicides. We generated a series of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutated ALS (mALS) genes and introduced constructs with mALS and the aminoglycoside 3'-adenyltransferase gene (aadA) into the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) chloroplast genome by particle bombardment. Transplastomic plants were selected using their resistance to spectinomycin. The effects of herbicides on transplastomic mALS activity were examined by a colorimetric assay using the leaves of transplastomic plants. We found that transplastomic G121A, A122V, and P197S plants were specifically tolerant to pyrimidinylcarboxylate, imidazolinon, and sulfonylurea/pyrimidinylcarboxylate herbicides, respectively. Transplastomic plants possessing mALSs were able to grow in the presence of various herbicides, thus affirming the relationship between mALSs and the associated resistance to herbicides. Our results show that mALS genes integrated into the chloroplast genome are useful sustainable markers that function to exclude plants other than those that are GM while maintaining transplastomic crops. This investigation suggests that the resistance management of weeds in the field amid growing GM crops is possible using (1) a series of mALSs that confer specific resistance to herbicides and (2) a strategy that employs herbicide rotation.",

author = "Yu, Qin and Powles, Stephen B",
abstract = "Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) inhibitor herbicides currently comprise the largest site-of-action group (with 54 active ingredients across five chemical groups) and have been widely used in world agriculture since they were first introduced in 1982. Resistance evolution in weeds to AHAS inhibitors has been rapid and identified in populations of many weed species. Often, evolved resistance is associated with point mutations in the target AHAS gene; however non-target-site enhanced herbicide metabolism occurs as well. Many AHAS gene resistance mutations can occur and be rapidly enriched owing to a high initial resistance gene frequency, simple and dominant genetic inheritance and lack of major fitness cost of the resistance alleles. Major advances in the elucidation of the crystal structure of the AHAS (Arabidopsis thaliana) catalytic subunit in complex with various AHAS inhibitor herbicides have greatly improved current understanding of the detailed molecular interactions between AHAS, cofactors and herbicides. Compared with target-site resistance, non-target-site resistance to AHAS inhibitor herbicides is less studied and hence less understood. In a few well-studied cases, non-target-site resistance is due to enhanced rates of herbicide metabolism (metabolic resistance), mimicking that occurring in tolerant crop species and often involving cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. However, the specific herbicide-metabolising, resistance-endowing genes are yet to be identified in resistant weed species. The current state of mechanistic understanding of AHAS inhibitor herbicide resistance is reviewed, and outstanding research issues are outlined.",

abstract = "Intracellular signaling pathways are mediated by changes in protein abundance and post-translational modifications. A common approach for investigating signaling mechanisms and the effects induced by synthetic compounds is through overexpression of recombinant reporter genes. Genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9 offers a means to better preserve native biology by appending reporters directly onto the endogenous genes. An optimal reporter for this purpose would be small to negligibly influence intracellular processes, be readily linked to the endogenous genes with minimal experimental effort, and be sensitive enough to detect low expressing proteins. HiBiT is a 1.3 kDa peptide (11 amino acids) capable of producing bright and quantitative luminescence through high affinity complementation (KD = 700 pM) with an 18 kDa subunit derived from NanoLuc (LgBiT). Using CRISPR/Cas9, we demonstrate that HiBiT can be rapidly and efficiently integrated into the genome to serve as a reporter tag for endogenous proteins. Without requiring clonal isolation of the edited cells, we were able to quantify changes in abundance of the hypoxia inducible factor 1A (HIF1$\alpha$) and several of its downstream transcriptional targets in response to various stimuli. In combination with fluorescent antibodies, we further used HiBiT to directly correlate HIF1$\alpha$ levels with the hydroxyproline modification that mediates its degradation. These results demonstrate the ability to efficiently tag endogenous proteins with a small luminescent peptide, allowing sensitive quantitation of the response dynamics in their regulated expression and covalent modifications.",

However, the fragments used are structurally compromised and have not been optimized nor thoroughly characterized for accurately assessing these interactions. We took advantage of the small size and bright luminescence of NanoLuc to engineer a new complementation reporter (NanoBiT). By design, the NanoBiT subunits (i.e., 1.3 kDa peptide, 18 kDa polypeptide) weakly associate so that their assembly into a luminescent complex is dictated by the interaction characteristics of the target proteins onto which they are appended. To ascertain their general suitability for measuring interaction affinities and kinetics, we determined that their intrinsic affinity (KD = 190 $\mu$M) and association constants (kon = 500 M(-1) s(-1), koff = 0.2 s(-1)) are outside of the ranges typical for protein interactions. The accuracy of NanoBiT was verified under defined biochemical conditions using the previously characterized interaction between SME-1 $\beta$-lactamase and a set of inhibitor binding proteins. In cells, NanoBiT fusions to FRB/FKBP produced luminescence consistent with the linear characteristics of NanoLuc. Response dynamics, evaluated using both protein kinase A and $\beta$-arrestin-2, were rapid, reversible, and robust to temperature (21-37 °C). Finally, NanoBiT provided a means to measure pharmacology of kinase inhibitors known to induce the interaction between BRAF and CRAF. Our results demonstrate that the intrinsic properties of NanoBiT allow accurate representation of protein interactions and that the reporter responds reliably and dynamically in cells.",

author = "Spampinato, Claudia P",
abstract = "The genome integrity of all organisms is constantly threatened by replication errors and DNA damage arising from endogenous and exogenous sources. Such base pair anomalies must be accurately repaired to prevent mutagenesis and/or lethality. Thus, it is not surprising that cells have evolved multiple and partially overlapping DNA repair pathways to correct specific types of DNA errors and lesions. Great progress in unraveling these repair mechanisms at the molecular level has been made by several talented researchers, among them Tomas Lindahl, Aziz Sancar, and Paul Modrich, all three Nobel laureates in Chemistry for 2015. Much of this knowledge comes from studies performed in bacteria, yeast, and mammals and has impacted research in plant systems. Two plant features should be mentioned. Plants differ from higher eukaryotes in that they lack a reserve germline and cannot avoid environmental stresses. Therefore, plants have evolved different strategies to sustain genome fidelity through generations and continuous exposure to genotoxic stresses. These strategies include the presence of unique or multiple paralogous genes with partially overlapping DNA repair activities. Yet, in spite (or because) of these differences, plants, especially Arabidopsis thaliana, can be used as a model organism for functional studies. Some advantages of this model system are worth mentioning: short life cycle, availability of both homozygous and heterozygous lines for many genes, plant transformation techniques, tissue culture methods and reporter systems for gene expression and function studies. Here, I provide a current understanding of DNA repair genes in plants, with a special focus on A. thaliana. It is expected that this review will be a valuable resource for future functional studies in the DNA repair field, both in plants and animals.",

title = "{DNA} damage and repair in plants - from models to crops",
author = "Manova, Vasilissa and Gruszka, Damian",
abstract = "The genomic integrity of every organism is constantly challenged by endogenous and exogenous DNA-damaging factors. Mutagenic agents cause reduced stability of plant genome and have a deleterious effect on development, and in the case of crop species lead to yield reduction. It is crucial for all organisms, including plants, to develop efficient mechanisms for maintenance of the genome integrity. DNA repair processes have been characterized in bacterial, fungal, and mammalian model systems. The description of these processes in plants, in contrast, was initiated relatively recently and has been focused largely on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Consequently, our knowledge about DNA repair in plant genomes - particularly in the genomes of crop plants - is by far more limited. However, the relatively small size of the Arabidopsis genome, its rapid life cycle and availability of various transformation methods make this species an attractive model for the study of eukaryotic DNA repair mechanisms and mutagenesis. Moreover, abnormalities in DNA repair which proved to be lethal for animal models are tolerated in plant genomes, although sensitivity to DNA damaging agents is retained. Due to the high conservation of DNA repair processes and factors mediating them among eukaryotes, genes and proteins that have been identified in model species may serve to identify homologous sequences in other species, including crop plants, in which these mechanisms are poorly understood. Crop breeding programs have provided remarkable advances in food quality and yield over the last century. Although the human population is predicted to ``peak'' by 2050, further advances in yield will be required to feed this population. Breeding requires genetic diversity. The biological impact of any mutagenic agent used for the creation of genetic diversity depends on the chemical nature of the induced lesions and on the efficiency and accuracy of their repair. More recent targeted mutagenesis procedures also depend on host repair processes, with different pathways yielding different products. Enhanced understanding of DNA repair processes in plants will inform and accelerate the engineering of crop genomes via both traditional and targeted approaches.",

This method, called genome-wide, unbiased identification of DSBs enabled by sequencing (GUIDE-seq), relies on capture of double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides into DSBs. Application of GUIDE-seq to 13 RGNs in two human cell lines revealed wide variability in RGN off-target activities and unappreciated characteristics of off-target sequences. The majority of identified sites were not detected by existing computational methods or chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). GUIDE-seq also identified RGN-independent genomic breakpoint 'hotspots'. Finally, GUIDE-seq revealed that truncated guide RNAs exhibit substantially reduced RGN-induced, off-target DSBs. Our experiments define the most rigorous framework for genome-wide identification of RGN off-target effects to date and provide a method for evaluating the safety of these nucleases before clinical use.",

The resulting data sets allowed us to identify factors affecting PE2 efficiency and to develop three computational models to predict pegRNA efficiency. For a given target sequence, the computational models predict efficiencies of pegRNAs with different lengths of primer binding sites and reverse transcriptase templates for edits of various types and positions. Testing the accuracy of the predictions using test data sets that were not used for training, we found Spearman's correlations between 0.47 and 0.81.

We describe here tagmentation-based tag integration site sequencing (TTISS), an efficient, scalable method for analyzing double-strand breaks (DSBs) that we apply in parallel to eight Cas9 variants across 59 targets. Additionally, we generated thousands of other Cas9 variants and screened for variants with enhanced specificity and activity, identifying LZ3 Cas9, a high specificity variant with a unique +1 insertion profile. This comprehensive comparison reveals a general trade-off between Cas9 activity and specificity and provides information about the frequency of generation of +1 insertions, which has implications for correcting frameshift mutations.",

Functional complementation confirmed that both the albino and dwarf phenotypes of the pds3 mutant resulted from functional disruption of the PDS3 gene. Chloroplast development was arrested at the proplastid stage in the pds3 mutant. Further analysis showed that high level of phytoene was accumulated in the pds3 mutant. Addition of exogenous GA(3) could partially rescue the dwarf phenotype, suggesting that the dwarf phenotype of the pds3 mutant might be due to GA deficiency. Microarray and RT-PCR analysis showed that disrupting PDS3 gene resulted in gene expression changes involved in at least 20 metabolic pathways, including the inhibition of many genes in carotenoid, chlorophyll, and GA biosynthesis pathways. Our data suggest that the accumulated phytoene in the pds3 mutant might play an important role in certain negative feedbacks to affect gene expression of diverse cellular pathways.",

abstract = "Carotenoids are C40 tetraterpenoids synthesized by nuclear-encoded multienzyme complexes located in the plastids of higher plants. To understand further the components and mechanisms involved in carotenoid synthesis, we screened Arabidopsis for mutations that disrupt this pathway and cause accumulation of biosynthetic intermediates. Here, we report the identification and characterization of two nonallelic albino mutations, pds1 and pds2 (for phytoene desaturation), that are disrupted in phytoene desaturation and as a result accumulate phytoene, the first C40 compound of the pathway. Surprisingly, neither mutation maps to the locus encoding the phytoene desaturase enzyme, indicating that the products of at least three loci are required for phytoene desaturation in higher plants. Because phytoene desaturase catalyzes an oxidation reaction, it has been suggested that components of an electron transport chain may be involved in this reaction. Analysis of pds1 and pds2 shows that both mutants are plastoquinone and tocopherol deficient, in addition to their inability to desaturate phytoene. Separate steps of the plastoquinone/tocopherol biosynthetic pathway are affected by these two mutations. The pds1 mutation affects the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase because it can be rescued by growth on the product but not the substrate of this enzyme, homogentisic acid and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, respectively. The pds2 mutation most likely affects the prenyl/phytyl transferase enzyme of this pathway. Because tocopherol-deficient mutants in the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus can synthesize carotenoids, our findings demonstrate conclusively that plastoquinone is an essential component in carotenoid synthesis. We propose a model for carotenoid synthesis in photosynthetic tissue whereby plastoquinone acts as an intermediate electron carrier between carotenoid desaturases and the photosynthetic electron transport chain.",

Each of the four sgRNAs we tested targets dCas9 to between tens and thousands of genomic sites, frequently characterized by a 5-nucleotide seed region in the sgRNA and an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Chromatin inaccessibility decreases dCas9 binding to other sites with matching seed sequences; thus 70\% of off-target sites are associated with genes. Targeted sequencing of 295 dCas9 binding sites in mESCs transfected with catalytically active Cas9 identified only one site mutated above background levels.

This is also driven by the fact that designing highly specific and efficient guides is a crucial, but not trivial, task in using CRISPR for gene editing. Here, we thoroughly analyse the performance of 18 design tools. They are evaluated based on runtime performance, compute requirements, and guides generated. To achieve this, we implemented a method for auditing system resources while a given tool executes, and tested each tool on datasets of increasing size, derived from the mouse genome. We found that only five tools had a computational performance that would allow them to analyse an entire genome in a reasonable time, and without exhausting computing resources. There was wide variation in the guides identified, with some tools reporting every possible guide while others filtered for predicted efficiency. Some tools also failed to exclude guides that would target multiple positions in the genome. We also considered two collections with over a thousand guides each, for which experimental data is available. There is a lot of variation in performance between the datasets, but the relative order of the tools is partially conserved. Importantly, the most striking result is a lack of consensus between the tools. Our results show that CRISPR-Cas9 guide design tools need further work in order to achieve rapid whole-genome analysis and that improvements in guide design will likely require combining multiple approaches.",

In this study, we developed a general strategy to produce numerous gRNAs from a single polycistronic gene. The endogenous tRNA-processing system, which precisely cleaves both ends of the tRNA precursor, was engineered as a simple and robust platform to boost the targeting and multiplex editing capability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. We demonstrated that synthetic genes with tandemly arrayed tRNA-gRNA architecture were efficiently and precisely processed into gRNAs with desired 5' targeting sequences in vivo, which directed Cas9 to edit multiple chromosomal targets. Using this strategy, multiplex genome editing and chromosomal-fragment deletion were readily achieved in stable transgenic rice plants with a high efficiency (up to 100\%).

Genome-wide screens in model organisms have been performed, accurate models of human diseases have been constructed, and potential therapies have been tested and validated in animal models. Several achievements in genetic modification of animals have been translated into products for the agricultural and pharmaceutical industries. Based on the remarkable progress to date, one may anticipate that in the future, CRISPR--Cas9 technology will enable additional far-reaching advances, including understanding the bases of diseases with complex genetic origins, engineering animals to produce organs for human transplantation, and genetically transforming entire populations of organisms to prevent the spread of disease.",

More importantly, brains of HD KI pig display striking and selective degeneration of striatal medium spiny neurons.

abstract = "The ideotype is a theoretical model of an archetypal cultivated plant. Recent progress in genome editing is aiding the pursuit of this ideal in crop breeding. Breeding is relatively straightforward when the traits in question are monogenic in nature and show Mendelian inheritance. Conversely, traits with a diffuse, polygenic basis such as abiotic stress resistance are more difficult to harness. In recent years, many genes have been identified that are important for plant domestication and act by increasing yield, grain or fruit size or altering plant architecture. Here, we propose that (a) key monogenic traits whose physiology has been unveiled can be molecularly tailored to achieve the ideotype; and (b) wild relatives of crops harboring polygenic stress resistance genes or other traits of interest could be de novo domesticated by manipulating monogenic yield-related traits through state-of-the-art gene editing techniques. An overview of the genomic and physiological challenges in the world's main staple crops is provided. We focus on tomato and its wild Solanum (section Lycopersicon) relatives as a suitable model for molecular design in the pursuit of the ideotype for elite cultivars and to test de novo domestication of wild relatives.",

We recently reported an alternative method of gene knock-in, named the PITCh (Precise Integration into Target Chromosome) system, assisted by microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ). MMEJ harnesses independent machinery from HR, and it requires an extremely short homologous sequence (5-25 bp) for DSB repair, resulting in precise gene knock-in with a more easily constructed donor vector. Here we describe a streamlined protocol for PITCh knock-in, including the design and construction of the PITCh vectors, and their delivery to either human cell lines by transfection or to frog embryos by microinjection. The construction of the PITCh vectors requires only a few days, and the entire process takes ∼ 1.5 months to establish knocked-in cells or ∼ 1 week from injection to early genotyping in frog embryos.",

abstract = "CRISPR/Cas12a is a single effector nuclease that, like CRISPR/Cas9, has been harnessed for genome editing based on its ability to generate targeted DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Unlike the blunt-ended DSB generated by Cas9, Cas12a generates sticky-ended DSB that could potentially aid precise genome editing, but this unique feature has thus far been underutilized. In the current study, we found that a short double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) repair template containing a sticky end that matched one of the Cas12a-generated DSB ends and a homologous arm sharing homology with the genomic region adjacent to the other end of the DSB enabled precise repair of the DSB and introduced a desired nucleotide substitution. We termed this strategy 'Ligation-Assisted Homologous Recombination' (LAHR). Compared to the single-stranded oligo deoxyribonucleotide (ssODN)-mediated homology directed repair (HDR), LAHR yields relatively high editing efficiency as demonstrated for both a reporter gene and endogenous genes. We found that both HDR and microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) mechanisms are involved in the LAHR process.

Direct somatic embryogenesis of Nicotiana by using BAP and IAA has not been investigated so far. This method does not require formation of callus tissues which leads to somaclonal variations. The frequency of somatic embryogenesis was strongly influenced by the plant growth hormones. The somatic embryos developing directly from explant tissue were noticed after 6 d of culture. Somatic embryogenesis of a high frequency (87-96\%) was observed in cultures of the all four genotypes (Nicotiana tabacum, N. benthamiyana, N. xanthi, N. t cv petihavana). The results showed that the best medium for direct somatic embryogenesis was MS supplemented with 2.5 mg/l, 0.2 mg/l IAA and 2\% sucrose. Subculture of somatic embryos onto hormone free MS medium resulted in their conversion into plants for all genotypes. About 95\% of the regenerated somatic embryos germinated into complete plantlets. The plants showed morphological and growth characteristics similar to those of seed-derived plants. Explants were transformed using Agrobacterium tumifacious LBA4404 plasmid pCAMBIA1301 harboring the GUS gene. The regenerated transgenic plants were confirmed by PCR analysis and histochemical GUS assay. The transformation efficiency obtained by using the Agrobacterium- mediated transformation was more than 95\%. This method takes 6 wk to accomplish complete transgenic plants through direct somatic embryogenesis. The transgenic plantlets were acclimatized successfully with 98\% survival in greenhouse and they showed normal morphological characteristics and were fertile. The regeneration and transformation method described herein is very simple, highly efficient and fast for the introduction of any foreign gene directly in tobacco through direct somatic embryogenesis.",

abstract = "Public engagement in science with diverse cross-sections of the community is considered a critical aspect of responsible biotechnological innovation. While the research community shows willingness to engage with both ambivalent and supportive audiences about potentially disruptive technological advances, there is less enthusiasm for engaging with groups who hold deeply opposing views to such advances. 'Playing God' and 'tampering with nature' are popular examples of intrinsic objections often made in opposition to the development or use of novel genetic technologies. Historically appearing in arguments against the pursuit of genetically modified organisms in agriculture and food industries, intrinsic objections have previously been labelled by the science community as inconsistent, non-scientific, and vague. Now found in a range of innovation contexts, the domain of synthetic biology appears to attract such objections consistently. We present the findings from a large Australian study (N = 4593) which suggests 'playing God' objections and their variants can be multilayered and, at times, accompanied by meaningful information about risk perceptions. We use qualitative analysis of open-ended responses from an online survey to show how these objections are articulated in response to selected synthetic biology applications across environmental and health domains. Our research invites a rethink of how the synthetic biology community perceives, and engages with, people who express intrinsic objections. These people may additionally hold extrinsic concerns that may be potentially addressed, or at least reasonably considered, through dialogue. We offer some concluding remarks for engaging with publics who employ these types of arguments to communicate unease with aspects of technology development and use.",

Therefore, it is important to understand how the production of such RNAs are controlled. In addition to the three canonical DNA dependent RNA polymerases (Pol) Pol I, II and III, two non-redundant plant-specific RNA polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V, have been identified and shown to generate noncoding RNAs that are required for transcriptional gene silencing via the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. Thus, somewhat paradoxically, transcription is required for gene silencing. This paradox extends beyond plants, as silencing pathways in yeast, fungi, flies, worms, and mammals also require transcriptional machinery [4,5]. As plants have evolved specialized RNA polymerases to carry out gene silencing in a manner that is separate from the essential roles of Pol II, their characterization offers unique insights into how RNA polymerases facilitate gene silencing. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms of Pol IV and Pol V function, including their compositions, their transcripts, and their modes of recruitment to chromatin.",

Although the generation of specific DNA methylation patterns is critical for these processes, how methylation is regulated at individual loci remains unclear. Here we show that a family of four putative chromatin remodeling factors, CLASSY (CLSY) 1-4, are required for both locus-specific and global regulation of DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Mechanistically, these factors act in connection with RNA polymerase-IV (Pol-IV) to control the production of 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (24nt-siRNAs), which guide DNA methylation. Individually, the CLSYs regulate Pol-IV-chromatin association and 24nt-siRNA production at thousands of distinct loci, and together, they regulate essentially all 24nt-siRNAs. Depending on the CLSYs involved, this regulation relies on different repressive chromatin modifications to facilitate locus-specific control of DNA methylation. Given the conservation between methylation systems in plants and mammals, analogous pathways may operate in a broad range of organisms.",

The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system is one of several powerful tools available for targeted gene editing, a crucial strategy for analyzing gene function.

Progeny of both sgs3 and rdr6 null mutants were sterile. Our analysis of the phenotypes of the regenerated progeny indicated that except for the predicted phenotypes, they grew normally, with no unexpected traits.

Protoplast transfection and regeneration systems are useful platforms for CRISPR/Cas mutagenesis and genome editing. In this study, we demonstrate the use of Cpf1 (Cas12a) and nCas9-activation-induced cytidine deaminase (nCas9-Target-AID) systems to mutagenize Nicotiana tabacum protoplasts and to regenerate plants harboring the resulting mutations. We analyzed 20 progeny plants of Cas12a-mediated phytoene desaturase (PDS) mutagenized regenerants, as well as regenerants from wild-type protoplasts, and confirmed that their genotypes were inherited in a Mendelian manner. We used a Cas9 nickase (nCas9)-cytidine deaminase to conduct C to T editing of the Ethylene receptor 1 (ETR1) gene in tobacco protoplasts and obtained edited regenerates. It is difficult to obtain homozygous edits of polyploid genomes when the editing efficiency is low. A second round of mutagenesis of partially edited regenerants (a two-step transfection protocol) allowed us to derive ETR1 fully edited regenerants without the need for sexual reproduction. We applied three different Cas systems (SaCas9, Cas12a, and nCas9-Traget AID) using either a one-step or a two-step transfection platform to obtain triply mutated and/or edited tobacco regenerants. Our results indicate that these three Cas systems can function simultaneously within a single cell.",

They can affect all elements of genes, including promoters, untranslated regions, exons, introns, and terminators, controlling gene expression at various levels, including modifying chromatin accessibility, transcription, splicing, and translation. Certain lncRNAs protect genome integrity, while others respond to environmental cues like temperature, drought, nutrients, and pathogens.

In Arabidopsis, the biogenesis of diRNAs requires the PI3 kinase ATR, RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), and Dicer-like proteins. Mutations in these proteins as well as in Pol V cause significant reduction in DSB repair efficiency. In Arabidopsis, diRNAs are recruited by Argonaute 2 (AGO2) to mediate DSB repair. Knock down of Dicer or Ago2 in human cells reduces DSB repair. Our findings reveal a conserved function for small RNAs in the DSB repair pathway.

Here we show that non-coding transcription by Pol V is controlled by preexisting chromatin modifications located within the transcribed regions. Most Pol V transcripts are associated with AGO4 but are not sliced by AGO4. Pol V-dependent DNA methylation is established on both strands of DNA and is tightly restricted to Pol V-transcribed regions. This indicates that chromatin modifications are established in close proximity to Pol V. Finally, Pol V transcription is preferentially enriched on edges of silenced transposable elements, where Pol V transcribes into TEs.

We demonstrate that Rad51 accumulation at DSB sites and HR repair depend on catalytic activity and small RNA-binding capability of Ago2. In contrast, DSB resection as well as RPA and Mre11 loading is unaffected by Ago2 or Dicer depletion, suggesting that Ago2 very likely functions directly in mediating Rad51 accumulation at DSBs. Taken together, our findings suggest that guided by diRNAs, Ago2 can promote Rad51 recruitment and/or retention at DSBs to facilitate repair by HR.",

In this work, we show that SIRT6 directly recognizes DNA damage through a tunnel-like structure that has high affinity for DSB. SIRT6 relocates to sites of damage independently of signaling and known sensors. It activates downstream signaling for DSB repair by triggering ATM recruitment, H2AX phosphorylation and the recruitment of proteins of the homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining pathways. Our findings indicate that SIRT6 plays a previously uncharacterized role as a DNA damage sensor, a critical factor in initiating the DNA damage response (DDR). Moreover, other Sirtuins share some DSB-binding capacity and DDR activation. SIRT6 activates the DDR before the repair pathway is chosen, and prevents genomic instability. Our findings place SIRT6 as a sensor of DSB, and pave the road to dissecting the contributions of distinct DSB sensors in downstream signaling.",

Depletion of MMS22L or TONSL from human cells causes a high level of double-strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication. Both proteins accumulate at stressed replication forks, and depletion of MMS22L or TONSL from cells causes hypersensitivity to agents that cause S phase-associated DSBs, such as topoisomerase (TOP) inhibitors. In this light, MMS22L and TONSL are required for the HR-mediated repair of replication fork-associated DSBs. In cells depleted of either protein, DSBs induced by the TOP1 inhibitor camptothecin are resected normally, but the loading of the RAD51 recombinase is defective.

This is a consequence of reduced recruitment of the Rad51 loader MMS22L-TONSL to ssDNA, resulting in persistent RPA foci, extensive DNA end resection, persistent activation of the ATR-Chk1 pathway, and cell cycle arrest. In agreement, histones occupy ssDNA during DNA repair in yeast. We also uncovered DNA-PKcs-dependent DNA damage-induced ASF1A phosphorylation, which enhances chromatin assembly, promoting MMS22L-TONSL recruitment and, hence, Rad51 loading. We propose that transient assembly of newly synthesized histones onto ssDNA serves to recruit MMS22L-TONSL to efficiently form the Rad51 nucleofilament for strand invasion, suggesting an active role of chromatin assembly in homologous recombination.",

While many studies considered DNA sequences of CRISPR target sites as the primary determinant for CRISPR mutagenesis efficiency and mutation profiles, increasing evidence revealed the significant role of chromatin context. Nonetheless, most of the prior studies were limited by the lack of sufficient epigenetic resources and/or by only transiently expressing CRISPR-Cas9 in a short time window. In this study, we leveraged the wealth of high-resolution epigenomic resources in Arabidopsis thaliana to address the impact of chromatin features on CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis using stable transgenic plants. Our results indicated that DNA methylation and chromatin features could lead to significant variations in mutagenesis efficiency by up to 250 folds. Low mutagenesis efficiencies were mostly associated with repressive heterochromatic features. This repressive effect appeared to persist through cell divisions but could be alleviated through substantial reduction of DNA methylation at CRISPR target sites. Moreover, specific chromatin features, such as H3K4me1, H3.3, and H3.1, appear to be associated with significant variations in CRISPR-Cas9 mutation profiles reflected by the 1 bp insertion rates. Our findings provided strong evidence that specific chromatin features could have significant and lasting impacts on both CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis efficiency and DNA double strand break repair outcomes. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

In this study, we investigated the effect of the level of cytosine methylation on the outcome of CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutations at multiple Cas9 target sites in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells using Next-Generation Sequencing. 3. We found that high levels of promoter methylation, but not gene-body methylation, decreased the frequency of Cas9-mediated mutations. DNA methylation also influenced the ratio of insertions and deletions and potentially the type of Cas9 cleavage in a target-specific manner. In addition, we detected an over-representation of deletion events governed by a single 5'-terminal nucleotide at Cas9-induced DNA breaks. 4. Our findings suggest that DNA methylation can indirectly impair Cas9 activity and subsequent DNA repair, likely through changes in the local chromatin structure. In addition to the well-described Cas9-induced blunt-end double-stranded DNA breaks, we provide evidence for Cas9-mediated staggered DNA cuts in plant cells.

Although substantial knowledge has accumulated on how a few plant cis-regulatory elements (CREs) function in stress regulation, many more CREs remain to be discovered. In addition, the plant stress cis-regulatory code, i.e., how CREs work independently and/or in concert to specify stress-responsive transcription, is mostly unknown. On the basis of gene expression patterns under multiple stresses, we identified a large number of putative CREs (pCREs) in Arabidopsis thaliana with characteristics of authentic cis-elements. Surprisingly, biotic and abiotic responses are mostly mediated by two distinct pCRE superfamilies. In addition, we uncovered cis-regulatory codes specifying how pCRE presence and absence, combinatorial relationships, location, and copy number can be used to predict stress-responsive expression. Expression prediction models based on pCRE combinations perform significantly better than those based on simply pCRE presence and absence, location, and copy number. Furthermore, instead of a few master combinatorial rules for each stress condition, many rules were discovered, and each appears to control only a small subset of stress-responsive genes. Given there are very few documented interactions between plant CREs, the combinatorial rules we have uncovered significantly contribute to a better understanding of the cis-regulatory logic underlying plant stress response and provide prioritized targets for experimentation.",

Subsequently, the perturbation-induced effects are evaluated by sequencing-based counting of the guide RNAs that specify each perturbation. The typical results of such screens are ranked lists of genes that confer sensitivity or resistance to the biological challenge of interest. Contributing to the broad utility of CRISPR screens, adaptations of the core CRISPR technology make it possible to activate, silence or otherwise manipulate the target genes.

Current optimized prime editing strategy (PE3) uses two guide RNAs to guide the performance of prime editor. One guide RNA carrying both spacer and templating sequences (pegRNA) guides prime editor to produce ssDNA break and subsequent extension, and the other one produces a nick in the complementary strand. Here, we demonstrated that positioning the nick sgRNA nearby the templating sequences of the pegRNA facilitated targeted large fragment deletion and that engineering both guide RNAs to be pegRNAs to achieve bi-direction prime editing (Bi-PE) further increase the efficiency by up to 16 times and improved the accuracy of editing products by 60 times. In addition, we showed that Bi-PE strategy also increased the efficiency of simultaneous conversion of multiple bases but not single base conversion over PE3. In conclusion, Bi-PE strategy expanded the editing scope and improved the efficiency and the accuracy of prime editing system, which might have a wide range of potential applications.",

Here we show that both phenomena influence Cas9 activity by comparing mutagenesis rates in zebrafish embryos with in vitro cleavage assays. In vivo, our results suggest that genomic factors such as CTCF inhibit mutagenesis. Comparing near-identical gRNA sequences with different in vitro activities reveals that internal gRNA interactions reduce cleavage. Even though gRNAs containing these structures do not yield cleavage-competent complexes, they can compete with active gRNAs for binding to Cas9.

Heterochromatic regions of the genome are generally transcriptionally silent, while euchromatin is more prone to transcription. During DNA replication, both genetic information and chromatin modifications must be faithfully passed on to daughter strands. There is evidence that DNA polymerases play a role in transcriptional silencing, but the extent of their contribution and how it relates to heterochromatin maintenance is unclear. RESULTS: We isolate a strong hypomorphic Arabidopsis thaliana mutant of the POL2A catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon and show that POL2A is required to stabilize heterochromatin silencing genome-wide, likely by preventing replicative stress. We reveal that POL2A inhibits DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 9 methylation. Hence, the release of heterochromatin silencing in POL2A-deficient mutants paradoxically occurs in a chromatin context of increased levels of these two repressive epigenetic marks. At the nuclear level, the POL2A defect is associated with fragmentation of heterochromatin. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that POL2A is critical to heterochromatin structure and function, and that unhindered replisome progression is required for the faithful propagation of DNA methylation throughout the cell cycle.",

This is particularly important in plants because the whole plant body and reproductive cells originate from meristematic cells that retain their proliferative capacity throughout the life cycle of the organism. DNA replication involves large sets of proteins whose activity is strictly regulated, and is tightly linked to the DNA damage response to detect and respond to replication errors or defects. Central to this interconnection is the replicative polymerase DNA Polymerase ϵ (Pol ϵ) which participates in DNA replication per se, as well as replication stress response in animals and in yeast. Surprisingly, its function has to date been little explored in plants, and notably its relationship with DNA Damage Response (DDR) has not been investigated. Here, we have studied the role of the largest regulatory sub-unit of Arabidopsis DNA Pol ϵ: DPB2, using an over-expression strategy.

We investigated the role of DNA polymerase epsilon during gametophyte and seed development using forward and reverse genetic approaches. In Arabidopsis, the catalytic subunit of this complex is encoded by two genes, AtPOL2a and AtPOL2b, whereas the second largest regulatory subunit AtDPB2 is present as a unique complete copy. Disruption of AtPOL2a or AtDPB2 resulted in a sporophytic embryo-defective phenotype, whilst mutations in AtPOL2b produced no visible effects. Loss of AtDPB2 function resulted in a severe reduction in nuclear divisions, both in the embryo and in the endosperm. Mutations in AtPOL2a allowed several rounds of mitosis to proceed, often with aberrant planes of division. Moreover, AtDPB2 was not expressed during development of the female gametophyte, which requires three post-meiotic nuclear divisions. Since a consensus binding site for E2F transcription factors was identified in the promoter region of both genes, the promoter-reporter fusion technique was used to show that luciferase activity was increased at specific phases of the cell cycle in synchronized tobacco BY-2 cells.

author = "Velten, Jeff and Cakir, Cahid and Cazzonelli, Christopher I",
abstract = "BACKGROUND: In part due to the ease of visual detection of phenotypic changes, anthocyanin pigment production has long been the target of genetic and molecular research in plants. Specific members of the large family of plant myb transcription factors have been found to play critical roles in regulating expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and these genes continue to serve as important tools in dissecting the molecular mechanisms of plant gene regulation. FINDINGS: A spontaneous mutation within the coding region of an Arabidopsis 35S::AtMYB90 transgene converted the activator of plant-wide anthocyanin production to a dominant-negative allele (PG-1) that inhibits normal pigment production within tobacco petals. Sequence analysis identified a single base change that created a premature nonsense codon, truncating the encoded myb protein. The resulting mutant protein lacks 78 amino acids from the wild type C-terminus and was confirmed as the source of the white-flower phenotype. A putative tobacco homolog of AtMYB90 (NtAN2) was isolated and found to be expressed in flower petals but not leaves of all tobacco plants tested. Using transgenic tobacco constitutively expressing the NtAN2 gene confirmed the NtAN2 protein as the likely target of PG-1-based inhibition of tobacco pigment production. CONCLUSIONS: Messenger RNA and anthocyanin analysis of PG-1Sh transgenic lines (and PG-1Sh x purple 35S::NtAN2 seedlings) support a model in which the mutant myb transgene product acts as a competitive inhibitor of the native tobacco NtAN2 protein. This finding is important to researchers in the field of plant transcription factor analysis, representing a potential outcome for experiments analyzing in vivo protein function in test transgenic systems that over-express or mutate plant transcription factors.",

This line, 16c, expresses the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP), highly and constitutively, and has been a major resource for visualising the mobility and actions of small RNAs. Insights into the mechanisms studied at a molecular level in N. benthamiana 16c are likely to be deeper and more accurate with a greater knowledge of the GFP gene integration site. Therefore, using next generation sequencing, genome mapping and local alignment, we identified the location and characteristics of the integrated T-DNA. As suggested from previous molecular hybridisation and inheritance data, the transgenic line contains a single GFP-expressing locus. However, the GFP coding sequence differs from that originally reported. Furthermore, a 3.2 kb portion of a transposon, appears to have co-integrated with the T-DNA. The location of the integration mapped to a region of the genome represented by Nbv0.5scaffold4905 in the www.benthgenome.com assembly, and with less integrity to Niben101Scf03641 in the www.solgenomics.net assembly. The transposon is not endogenous to laboratory strains of N. benthamiana or Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 (MP90), which was reportedly used in the generation of line 16c. However, it is present in the popular LBA4404 strain. The integrated transposon sequence includes its 5' terminal repeat and a transposase gene, and is immediately adjacent to the GFP gene.

The type II CRISPR/Cas system has been adapted for genome editing in many cell types and organisms. A recent study used the catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) protein combined with guide-RNAs (gRNAs) as a DNA-targeting platform to modulate gene expression in bacterial, yeast, and human cells. Here, we modified this DNA-targeting platform for targeted transcriptional regulation in planta by developing chimeric dCas9-based transcriptional activators and repressors. To generate transcriptional activators, we fused the dCas9 C-terminus with the activation domains of EDLL and TAL effectors. To generate a transcriptional repressor, we fused the dCas9 C-terminus with the SRDX repression domain. Our data demonstrate that dCas9 fusion with the EDLL activation domain (dCas9:EDLL) and the TAL activation domain (dCas9:TAD), guided by gRNAs complementary to selected promoter elements, induce strong transcriptional activation on Bs3::uidA targets in plant cells. Further, the dCas9:SRDX-mediated transcriptional repression of an endogenous gene. Thus, our results suggest that the synthetic transcriptional repressor (dCas9:SRDX) and activators (dCas9:EDLL and dCas9:TAD) can be used as endogenous transcription factors to repress or activate transcription of an endogenous genomic target. Our data indicate that the CRISPR/dCas9 DNA-targeting platform can be used in plants as a functional genomics tool and for biotechnological applications.",

Here, we investigate the structural roles of gRNAs in the CRISPR-Cas9 system by single-molecule spectroscopy and reveal a new conformation of inactive Cas9 that is thermodynamically more preferable than active apo-Cas9. We find that tracrRNA prevents Cas9 from changing into the inactive form and leads to the Cas9:gRNA complex. For the Cas9:gRNA complex, we identify sub-conformations of the RNA-DNA heteroduplex during R-loop expansion. Our single-molecule study indicates that the kinetics of the sub-conformations is controlled by the complementarity between crRNA and target DNA.

abstract = "Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is the main repair pathway for DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in cells with limited 5' resection. To better understand how overhang polarity of chromosomal DSBs affects NHEJ, we made site-specific 5'-overhanging DSBs (5' DSBs) in yeast using an optimized zinc finger nuclease at an efficiency that approached HO-induced 3' DSB formation. When controlled for the extent of DSB formation, repair monitoring suggested that chromosomal 5' DSBs were rejoined more efficiently than 3' DSBs, consistent with a robust recruitment of NHEJ proteins to 5' DSBs. Ligation-mediated qPCR revealed that Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 rapidly modified 5' DSBs and facilitated protection of 3' DSBs, likely through recognition of overhang polarity by the Mre11 nuclease. Next-generation sequencing revealed that NHEJ at 5' DSBs had a higher mutation frequency, and validated the differential requirement of Pol4 polymerase at 3' and 5' DSBs. The end processing enzyme Tdp1 did not impact joining fidelity at chromosomal 5' DSBs as in previous plasmid studies, although Tdp1 was recruited to only 5' DSBs in a Ku-independent manner. These results suggest distinct DSB handling based on overhang polarity that impacts NHEJ kinetics and fidelity through differential recruitment and action of DSB modifying enzymes.",

To study mechanisms determining intragenomic mutation rate variability, we reanalyzed 43,483 de novo germline single base substitutions in 1,504 fast neutron irradiated mutation accumulation lines in Kitaake rice. Mutation rates were significantly lower in genomic regions marked by H3K4me1, a histone modification found in the gene bodies of actively expressed and evolutionarily conserved genes in plants. We observed conservation in rice for PDS5C, a cohesion cofactor involved in the homology-directed repair pathway that in A. thaliana binds to H3K4me1 via its Tudor domain and localizes to regions exhibiting reduced mutation rates: coding regions, essential genes, constitutively expressed genes, and genes under stronger purifying selection, mirroring mutation biases observed in rice as well. We find that Tudor domains are significantly enriched in DNA repair proteins (p<1e-11). These include the mismatch repair MSH6 protein, suggesting that plants have evolved multiple DNA repair pathways that target gene bodies and essential genes through H3K4me1 binding, which is supported by models of protein-peptide docking. These findings inspire further research to characterize mechanisms localizing DNA repair, potentially tuning the evolutionary trajectories of plant genomes. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

Methods for generating refined mutations are desirable but currently unavailable. Here, we show that fusing Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I or the Klenow fragment to Cas9 greatly increases the frequencies of 1-bp deletions and decreases >1-bp deletions or insertions. Importantly, doing so also greatly decreases the generation of long deletions, including those >2 kb. In addition, templated insertions (the insertion of the nucleotide 4 nt upstream of the protospacer adjacent motif) were increased relative to other insertions. Counteracting DNA resection was one of the mechanisms perturbing deletion sizes. Targeting DNA polymerase to double-strand breaks did not increase off-targets or base substitution rates around the cleavage sites, yet increased editing efficiency in primary cells.

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Many applications of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing require Cas9-induced non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which was thought to be error prone. However, with directly ligatable ends, Cas9-induced DNA double strand breaks may be repaired preferentially by accurate NHEJ. RESULTS: In the repair of two adjacent double strand breaks induced by paired Cas9-gRNAs at 71 genome sites, accurate NHEJ accounts for about 50\% of NHEJ events. This paired Cas9-gRNA approach underestimates the level of accurate NHEJ due to frequent + 1 templated insertions, which can be avoided by the predefined Watson/Crick orientation of protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs). The paired Cas9-gRNA strategy also provides a flexible, reporter-less approach for analyzing both accurate and mutagenic NHEJ in cells and in vivo, and it has been validated in cells deficient for XRCC4 and in mouse liver. Due to high frequencies of precise deletions of defined ``3n''-, ``3n + 1''-, or ``3n + 2''-bp length, accurate NHEJ is used to improve the efficiency and homogeneity of gene knockouts and targeted in-frame deletions. Compared to ``3n + 1''-bp, ``3n + 2''-bp can overcome + 1 templated insertions to increase the frequency of out-of-frame mutations. By applying paired Cas9-gRNAs to edit MDC1 and key 53BP1 domains, we are able to generate predicted, precise deletions for functional analysis. Lastly, a Plk3 inhibitor promotes NHEJ with bias towards accurate NHEJ, providing a chemical approach to improve genome editing requiring precise deletions. CONCLUSIONS: NHEJ is inherently accurate in repair of Cas9-induced DNA double strand breaks and can be harnessed to improve CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing requiring precise deletion of a defined length.",

Here, through a small molecule screen, we identify the ATM kinase inhibitor KU-60019 as a compound capable of reproducibly increasing the fraction of 1-bp insertions relative to other Cas9 repair outcomes. Small molecule or genetic ATM inhibition increases 1-bp insertion outcome fraction across three human and mouse cell lines, two Cas9 species, and dozens of target sites, although concomitantly reducing the fraction of edited alleles. Notably, KU-60019 increases the relative frequency of 1-bp insertions to over 80\% of edited alleles at several native human genomic loci and improves the efficiency of correction for pathogenic 1-bp deletion variants. The ability to increase 1-bp insertion frequency adds another dimension to precise template-free Cas9-nuclease genome editing.",

We performed more than 175 edits in human cells, including targeted insertions, deletions, and all 12 types of point mutation, without requiring double-strand breaks or donor DNA templates. We used prime editing in human cells to correct, efficiently and with few byproducts, the primary genetic causes of sickle cell disease (requiring a transversion in HBB) and Tay-Sachs disease (requiring a deletion in HEXA); to install a protective transversion in PRNP; and to insert various tags and epitopes precisely into target loci. Four human cell lines and primary post-mitotic mouse cortical neurons support prime editing with varying efficiencies. Prime editing shows higher or similar efficiency and fewer byproducts than homology-directed repair, has complementary strengths and weaknesses compared to base editing, and induces much lower off-target editing than Cas9 nuclease at known Cas9 off-target sites. Prime editing substantially expands the scope and capabilities of genome editing, and in principle could correct up to 89\% of known genetic variants associated with human diseases.",

PRIME-Del can also be used to couple genomic deletions with short insertions, enabling deletions with junctions that do not fall at protospacer-adjacent motif sites.

abstract = "Improved methods for engineering sequence-specific nucleases, including zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and TAL effector nucleases (TALENs), have made it possible to precisely modify plant genomes. However, the success of genome modification is largely dependent on the intrinsic activity of the engineered nucleases. In this study, we sought to enhance ZFN-mediated targeted mutagenesis and gene targeting (GT) in Arabidopsis by manipulating DNA repair pathways. Using a ZFN that creates a double-strand break (DSB) at the endogenous ADH1 locus, we analyzed repair outcomes in the absence of DNA repair proteins such as KU70 and LIG4 (both involved in classic nonhomologous end-joining, NHEJ) and SMC6B (involved in sister-chromatid-based homologous recombination, HR). We achieved a fivefold to 16-fold enhancement in HR-based GT in a ku70 mutant and a threefold to fourfold enhancement in GT in the lig4 mutant. Although the NHEJ mutagenesis frequency was not significantly changed in ku70 or lig4, DNA repair was shifted to microhomology-dependent alternative NHEJ. As a result, mutations in both ku70 and lig4 were predominantly large deletions, which facilitates easy screening for mutations by PCR. Interestingly, NHEJ mutagenesis and GT at the ADH1 locus were enhanced by sixfold to eightfold and threefold to fourfold, respectively, in a smc6b mutant. The increase in NHEJ-mediated mutagenesis by loss of SMC6B was further confirmed using ZFNs that target two other Arabidopsis genes, namely, TT4 and MPK8. Considering that components of DNA repair pathways are highly conserved across species, mutations in DNA repair genes likely provide a universal strategy for harnessing repair pathways to achieve desired targeted genome modifications.",

We used CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing to introduce mutations in all three SWEET gene promoters. Editing was further informed by sequence analyses of TALe genes in 63 Xoo strains, which revealed multiple TALe variants for SWEET13 alleles. Mutations were also created in SWEET14, which is also targeted by two TALes from an African Xoo lineage. A total of five promoter mutations were simultaneously introduced into the rice line Kitaake and the elite mega varieties IR64 and Ciherang-Sub1.

However, the transcription activator-like effector (TALE)-associated executor type R genes show no considerable sequence homology to any known R genes. We adopted a map-based cloning approach and TALE-based technology to isolate and characterize Xa23, a new executor R gene derived from wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) that confers an extremely broad spectrum of resistance to bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Xa23 encodes a 113 amino acid protein that shares 50\% identity with the known executor R protein XA10. The predicted transmembrane helices in XA23 also overlap with those of XA10. Unlike Xa10, however, Xa23 transcription is specifically activated by AvrXa23, a TALE present in all examined Xoo field isolates. Moreover, the susceptible xa23 allele has an identical open reading frame of Xa23 but differs in promoter region by lacking the TALE binding element (EBE) for AvrXa23. XA23 can trigger a strong hypersensitive response in rice, tobacco, and tomato.

abstract = "The rice (Oryza sativa) gene xa13 is a recessive resistance allele of Os-8N3, a member of the NODULIN3 (N3) gene family, located on rice chromosome 8. Os-8N3 is a susceptibility (S) gene for Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae, the causal agent of bacterial blight, and the recessive allele is defeated by strains of the pathogen producing any one of the type III effectors AvrXa7, PthXo2, or PthXo3, which are all members of the transcription activator-like (TAL) effector family. Both AvrXa7 and PthXo3 induce the expression of a second member of the N3 gene family, here named Os-11N3. Insertional mutagenesis or RNA-mediated silencing of Os-11N3 resulted in plants with loss of susceptibility specifically to strains of X. oryzae pv oryzae dependent on AvrXa7 or PthXo3 for virulence. We further show that AvrXa7 drives expression of Os-11N3 and that AvrXa7 interacts and binds specifically to an effector binding element within the Os-11N3 promoter, lending support to the predictive models for TAL effector binding specificity. The result indicates that variations in the TAL effector repetitive domains are driven by selection to overcome both dominant and recessive forms of resistance to bacterial blight in rice. The finding that Os-8N3 and Os-11N3 encode closely related proteins also provides evidence that N3 proteins have a specific function in facilitating bacterial blight disease.",

Arabidopsis SWEET8 is essential for pollen viability, and the rice homologues SWEET11 and SWEET14 are specifically exploited by bacterial pathogens for virulence by means of direct binding of a bacterial effector to the SWEET promoter. Bacterial symbionts and fungal and bacterial pathogens induce the expression of different SWEET genes, indicating that the sugar efflux function of SWEET transporters is probably targeted by pathogens and symbionts for nutritional gain.

author = "Puchta, Holger",
abstract = "The efficient repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in genomic DNA is important for the survival of all organisms. In recent years, basic mechanisms of DSB repair in somatic plant cells have been elucidated. DSBs are mainly repaired by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). The repair can be associated with deletions, but also insertions due to copying genomic sequences from elsewhere into the break. Species-specific differences of NHEJ have been reported and an inverse correlation of deletion size to genome size has been postulated, indicating that NHEJ might contribute significantly to evolution of genome size. DSB repair by homologous recombination (HR) might also influence genome organization. Whereas homology present in an allelic or an ectopic position is hardly used for repair, the use of homologous sequences in close proximity to the break is frequent. A 'single-strand annealing' mechanism that leads to sequence deletions between direct repeats is particularly efficient. This might explain the accumulation of single long terminal repeats of retroelements in cereal genomes. The conservative 'synthesis-dependent strand annealing' mechanism, resulting in conversions without crossovers is also prominent and seems to be significant for the evolution of tandemly arranged gene families such as resistance genes. Induction of DSBs could be used as a means for the controlled manipulation of plant genomes in an analogous way for the use of marker gene excision and site-specific integration.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: The use of homologous recombination to precisely modify plant genomes has been challenging, due to the lack of efficient methods for delivering DNA repair templates to plant cells. Even with the advent of sequence-specific nucleases, which stimulate homologous recombination at predefined genomic sites by creating targeted DNA double-strand breaks, there are only a handful of studies that report precise editing of endogenous genes in crop plants. More efficient methods are needed to modify plant genomes through homologous recombination, ideally without randomly integrating foreign DNA. RESULTS: Here, we use geminivirus replicons to create heritable modifications to the tomato genome at frequencies tenfold higher than traditional methods of DNA delivery (i.e., Agrobacterium). A strong promoter was inserted upstream of a gene controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis, resulting in overexpression and ectopic accumulation of pigments in tomato tissues. More than two-thirds of the insertions were precise, and had no unanticipated sequence modifications. Both TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 achieved gene targeting at similar efficiencies. Further, the targeted modification was transmitted to progeny in a Mendelian fashion. Even though donor molecules were replicated in the vectors, no evidence was found of persistent extra-chromosomal replicons or off-target integration of T-DNA or replicon sequences. CONCLUSIONS: High-frequency, precise modification of the tomato genome was achieved using geminivirus replicons, suggesting that these vectors can overcome the efficiency barrier that has made gene targeting in plants challenging. This work provides a foundation for efficient genome editing of crop genomes without the random integration of foreign DNA.",

Our reagents, based on transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system, are systematized for fast, modular cloning and accommodate diverse regulatory sequences to drive reagent expression. Vectors are optimized to create either single or multiple gene knockouts and large chromosomal deletions. Moreover, integration of geminivirus-based vectors enables precise gene editing through homologous recombination. Regulation of transcription is also possible. A Web-based tool streamlines vector selection and construction. One advantage of our platform is the use of the Csy-type (CRISPR system yersinia) ribonuclease 4 (Csy4) and tRNA processing enzymes to simultaneously express multiple guide RNAs (gRNAs). For example, we demonstrate targeted deletions in up to six genes by expressing 12 gRNAs from a single transcript. Csy4 and tRNA expression systems are almost twice as effective in inducing mutations as gRNAs expressed from individual RNA polymerase III promoters. Mutagenesis can be further enhanced 2.5-fold by incorporating the Trex2 exonuclease. Finally, we demonstrate that Cas9 nickases induce gene targeting at frequencies comparable to native Cas9 when they are delivered on geminivirus replicons. The reagents have been successfully validated in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), Medicago truncatula, wheat (Triticum aestivum), and barley (Hordeum vulgare).",

This massive multiplexing of CRISPR is enabled by means of multi-target guide RNAs (mgRNAs), degenerate guide RNAs that direct Cas9 to a pre-determined number of well-mapped sites. mgRNAs uncovered generalizable insights into Cas9 binding and cleavage, revealing rapid post-cleavage Cas9 departure and repair factor loading at protospacer adjacent motif-proximal genomic DNA. Moreover, by bypassing confounding effects from guide RNA sequence, mgRNAs unveiled that Cas9 binding is enhanced at chromatin-accessible regions, and cleavage by bound Cas9 is more efficient near transcribed regions. Combined with light-mediated activation and deactivation of Cas9 activity, mgRNAs further enabled high-throughput study of the cellular response to double-strand breaks with high temporal resolution, revealing the presence, extent (under 2 kb) and kinetics (~1 h) of reversible DNA damage-induced chromatin decompaction. Altogether, this work establishes mgRNAs as a generalizable platform for multiplexing CRISPR and advances our understanding of intracellular Cas9 activity and the DNA damage response at endogenous loci.",

Here we investigate the interaction of Cas9 with target DNA and use our findings to improve HDR efficiency. We show that dissociation of Cas9 from double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) substrates is slow (lifetime ∼6 h) but that, before complete dissociation, Cas9 asymmetrically releases the 3' end of the cleaved DNA strand that is not complementary to the sgRNA (nontarget strand). By rationally designing single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) donors of the optimal length complementary to the strand that is released first, we increase the rate of HDR in human cells when using Cas9 or nickase variants to up to 60\%. We also demonstrate HDR rates of up to 0.7\% using a catalytically inactive Cas9 mutant (dCas9), which binds DNA without cleaving it.",

We then used these to develop a range of operational logic gates using the identify function (activation) and negation function (repression) in Arabidopsis protoplasts and in vivo, demonstrating their utility for programmable manipulation of transcriptional activity in a complex multicellular organism. Specifically, using recombinases and plant control elements, we activated transgenes in YES, OR and AND gates and repressed them in NOT, NOR and NAND gates; we also implemented the A NIMPLY B gate that combines activation and repression. Through use of genetic recombination, these circuits create stable long-term changes in expression and recording of past stimuli.

These stem cell populations remain active throughout the plant's life, which can last for centuries, and are particularly exposed to environmental hazards that cause DNA damage and mutations. It is not known whether plants have mechanisms to safeguard the genome specifically in these crucial cell populations. Here, we show that root and shoot stem cells and their early descendants are selectively killed by mild treatment with radiomimetic drugs, x-rays, or mutations that disrupt DNA repair by nonhomologous end-joining. Stem cell death required transduction of DNA damage signals by the ATAXIA-TELANGIECTASIA MUTATED (ATM) kinase and, specifically in the root, also the ATM/RAD3-RELATED (ATR) kinase. Consistent with the absence of p53 and the core apoptotic machinery in plants, death of the stem cells did not show apoptotic but autolytic features as seen in other cases of plant developmentally programmed cell death. We propose that plants have independently evolved selective death as a stringent mechanism to safeguard genome integrity in their stem cell populations.",

abstract = "DNA polymerase lambda (Pol lambda) is one of several DNA polymerases suggested to participate in base excision repair (BER), in repair of broken DNA ends and in translesion synthesis. It has been proposed that the nature of the DNA intermediates partly determines which polymerase is used for a particular repair reaction. To test this hypothesis, here we examine the ability of human Pol lambda to extend mismatched primer-termini, either on 'open' template-primer substrates, or on its preferred substrate, a 1 nt gapped-DNA molecule having a 5'-phosphate. Interestingly, Pol lambda extended mismatches with an average efficiency of approximately 10(-2) relative to matched base pairs. The match and mismatch extension catalytic efficiencies obtained on gapped molecules were approximately 260-fold higher than on template-primer molecules. A crystal structure of Pol lambda in complex with a single-nucleotide gap containing a dG.dGMP mismatch at the primer-terminus (2.40 A) suggests that, at least for certain mispairs, Pol lambda is unable to differentiate between matched and mismatched termini during the DNA binding step, thus accounting for the relatively high efficiency of mismatch extension. This property of Pol lambda suggests a potential role as a 'mismatch extender' during non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and possibly during translesion synthesis.",

author = "Tahirov, Tahir H and Makarova, Kira S and Rogozin, Igor B and Pavlov, Youri I and Koonin, Eugene V",
abstract = "BACKGROUND: Evolution of DNA polymerases, the key enzymes of DNA replication and repair, is central to any reconstruction of the history of cellular life. However, the details of the evolutionary relationships between DNA polymerases of archaea and eukaryotes remain unresolved. RESULTS: We performed a comparative analysis of archaeal, eukaryotic, and bacterial B-family DNA polymerases, which are the main replicative polymerases in archaea and eukaryotes, combined with an analysis of domain architectures. Surprisingly, we found that eukaryotic Polymerase epsilon consists of two tandem exonuclease-polymerase modules, the active N-terminal module and a C-terminal module in which both enzymatic domains are inactivated. The two modules are only distantly related to each other, an observation that suggests the possibility that Pol epsilon evolved as a result of insertion and subsequent inactivation of a distinct polymerase, possibly, of bacterial descent, upstream of the C-terminal Zn-fingers, rather than by tandem duplication. The presence of an inactivated exonuclease-polymerase module in Pol epsilon parallels a similar inactivation of both enzymatic domains in a distinct family of archaeal B-family polymerases. The results of phylogenetic analysis indicate that eukaryotic B-family polymerases, most likely, originate from two distantly related archaeal B-family polymerases, one form giving rise to Pol epsilon, and the other one to the common ancestor of Pol alpha, Pol delta, and Pol zeta. The C-terminal Zn-fingers that are present in all eukaryotic B-family polymerases, unexpectedly, are homologous to the Zn-finger of archaeal D-family DNA polymerases that are otherwise unrelated to the B family. The Zn-finger of Polepsilon shows a markedly greater similarity to the counterpart in archaeal PolD than the Zn-fingers of other eukaryotic B-family polymerases. CONCLUSION: Evolution of eukaryotic DNA polymerases seems to have involved previously unnoticed complex events. We hypothesize that the archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes encoded three DNA polymerases, namely, two distinct B-family polymerases and a D-family polymerase all of which contributed to the evolution of the eukaryotic replication machinery. The Zn-finger might have been acquired from PolD by the B-family form that gave rise to Pol epsilon prior to or in the course of eukaryogenesis, and subsequently, was captured by the ancestor of the other B-family eukaryotic polymerases. The inactivated polymerase-exonuclease module of Pol epsilon might have evolved by fusion with a distinct polymerase, rather than by duplication of the active module of Pol epsilon, and is likely to play an important role in the assembly of eukaryotic replication and repair complexes.",

title = "Yeast Spontaneous Mutation Rate and Spectrum Vary with Environment",
author = "Liu, Haoxuan and Zhang, Jianzhi",
abstract = "Mutation is the ultimate genetic source of evolution and biodiversity, but to what extent the environment impacts mutation rate and spectrum is poorly understood. Past studies discovered mutagenesis induced by antibiotic treatment or starvation, but its relevance and importance to long-term evolution is unclear because these severe stressors typically halt cell growth and/or cause substantial cell deaths. Here, we quantify the mutation rate and spectrum in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by whole-genome sequencing following mutation accumulation in each of seven environments with relatively rapid cell growths and minimal cell deaths. We find the point mutation rate per generation to differ by 3.6-fold among the seven environments, generally increasing in environments with slower cell growths. This trend renders the mutation rate per year more constant than that per generation across environments, which has implications for neutral evolution and the molecular clock. Additionally, we find substantial among-environment variations in mutation spectrum, such as the transition to transversion ratio and AT mutational bias. Other main mutation types, including small insertion or deletion, segmental duplication or deletion, and chromosome gain or loss also tend to occur more frequently in environments where yeast grows more slowly. In contrast to these findings from the nuclear genome, the yeast mitochondrial mutation rate rises with the growth rate, consistent with the metabolic rate hypothesis. Together, these observations indicate that environmental changes, which are ubiquitous in nature, influence not only natural selection, but also the amount and type of mutations available to selection, and suggest that ignoring the latter impact, as is currently practiced, may mislead evolutionary inferences.",

Although higher plants, like mammals, are thought to preferentially repair DSBs via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), much remains unclear about plant DSB repair pathways. Our reverse genetic approach suggests that DNA polymerase $\lambda$ is involved in DSB repair in Arabidopsis. The Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant (atpol$\lambda$-1) displayed sensitivity to both gamma-irradiation and treatment with radiomimetic reagents, but not to other DNA damaging treatments. The atpol$\lambda$-1 mutant showed a moderate sensitivity to DSBs, while Arabidopsis Ku70 and DNA ligase 4 mutants (atku70-3 and atlig4-2), both of which play critical roles in NHEJ, exhibited a hypersensitivity to these treatments. The atpol$\lambda$-1/atlig4-2 double mutant exhibited a higher sensitivity to DSBs than each single mutant, but the atku70/atpol$\lambda$-1 showed similar sensitivity to the atku70-3 mutant. We showed that transcription of the DNA ligase 1, DNA ligase 6, and Wee1 genes was quickly induced by BLM in several NHEJ deficient mutants in contrast to wild-type. Finally, the T-DNA transformation efficiency dropped in NHEJ deficient mutants and the lowest transformation efficiency was scored in the atpol$\lambda$-1/atlig4-2 double mutant. These results imply that AtPol$\lambda$ is involved in both DSB repair and DNA damage response pathway.",

abstract = "The nonhomologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ) pathway is a key mechanism for repairing dsDNA breaks that occur often in eukaryotic cells. In the simplest model, these breaks are first recognized by Ku, which then interacts with other NHEJ proteins to improve their affinity at DNA ends. These include DNA-PKcs and Artemis for trimming the DNA ends; DNA polymerase $\mu$ and $\lambda$ to add nucleotides; and the DNA ligase IV complex to ligate the ends with the additional factors, XRCC4 (X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 4), XLF (XRCC4-like factor/Cernunos), and PAXX (paralog of XRCC4 and XLF). In vivo studies have demonstrated the degrees of importance of these NHEJ proteins in the mechanism of repair of dsDNA breaks, but interpretations can be confounded by other cellular processes. In vitro studies with NHEJ proteins have been performed to evaluate the nucleolytic resection, polymerization, and ligation steps, but a complete system has been elusive. Here we have developed a NHEJ reconstitution system that includes the nuclease, polymerase, and ligase components to evaluate relative NHEJ efficiency and analyze ligated junctional sequences for various types of DNA ends, including blunt, 5' overhangs, and 3' overhangs. We find that different dsDNA end structures have differential dependence on these enzymatic components. The dependence of some end joining on only Ku and XRCC4·DNA ligase IV allows us to formulate a physical model that incorporates nuclease and polymerase components as needed.",

Cells are therefore endowed with a wide variety of enzymes that can deal with these chemical and structural variations and guarantee the formation of ligatable termini. An important distinction is whether the ends are directly ``unblocked'' by specific enzymatic activities without affecting the integrity of the DNA molecule and its sequence, or whether they are ``processed'' by unspecific nucleases that remove nucleotides from the termini. DNA end structure and configuration, therefore, shape the repair process, its requirements, and, importantly, its final outcome. Thus, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate and integrate the cellular response to blocked DSBs, although still largely unexplored, can be particularly relevant for maintaining genome integrity and avoiding malignant transformation and cancer.",

abstract = "Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repairs chromosome breaks and must remain effective in the face of extensive diversity in broken end structures. We show here that this flexibility is often reliant on the ability to direct DNA synthesis across strand breaks, and that polymerase (Pol) $\mu$ and Pol $\lambda$ are the only mammalian DNA polymerases that have this activity. By systematically varying substrate in cells, we show each polymerase is uniquely proficient in different contexts. The templating nucleotide is also selected differently, with Pol $\mu$ using the unpaired base adjacent to the downstream 5' phosphate even when there are available template sites further upstream of this position; this makes Pol $\mu$ more flexible but also less accurate than Pol $\lambda$. Loss of either polymerase alone consequently has clear and distinguishable effects on the fidelity of repair, but end remodeling by cellular nucleases and the remaining polymerase helps mitigate the effects on overall repair efficiency. Accordingly, when cells are deficient in both polymerases there is synergistic impact on NHEJ efficiency, both in terms of repair of defined substrates and cellular resistance to ionizing radiation. Pol $\mu$ and Pol $\lambda$ thus provide distinct solutions to a problem for DNA synthesis that is unique to this pathway and play a key role in conferring on NHEJ the flexibility required for accurate and efficient repair.",

We show NHEJ is uniquely proficient at bypassing subtle terminal mispairs and radiomimetic damage by direct ligation. Nevertheless, bypass ability varies widely, with increases in mispair severity gradually reducing bypass products from 85 to 6\%. End-processing by nucleases and polymerases is increased to compensate, although paths with the fewest number of steps to generate a substrate suitable for ligation are favoured. Thus, both the frequency and nature of end processing are tailored to meet the needs of the ligation step.

Results obtained so far indicate that plants share many BER factors with other organisms, but also possess some unique features and combinations.

Collectively, these data indicate that CMD2-type resistance is caused by a nonsynonymous, single nucleotide polymorphism in DNA polymerase $\delta$ subunit 1 (MePOLD1) located within this region. Virus-induced gene silencing of MePOLD1 in a CMD-susceptible cassava variety produced a recovery phenotype typical of CMD2-type resistance. Analysis of other CMD2-type cassava varieties identified additional candidate resistance alleles within MePOLD1.

Prime editing is a newly developed precise editing technology based on CRISPR-Cas9, which uses an engineered reverse transcriptase (RT), a catalytically impaired Cas9 endonuclease (nCas9), and a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA). In addition, prime editing has a wider range of editing types than base editing and can produce nearly all types of edits. Although prime editing was first established in human cells, it has recently been applied to plants. As a relatively new technique, optimization will be needed to increase the editing efficiency in different crops. In this study, we successfully edited a mutant GFP in rice, peanut, chickpea, and cowpea protoplasts. In rice, up to 16 times higher editing efficiency was achieved with a dual pegRNA than the single pegRNA containing vectors. Edited-mutant GFP protoplasts have also been obtained in peanut, chickpea, and cowpea after transformation with the dual pegRNA vectors, albeit with much lower editing efficiency than in rice, ranging from 0.2\% to 0.5\%.

D. radiodurans uses the same DNA-repair strategies as other prokaryotes, but certain proteins involved in the classical DNA repair machinery have characteristics different from their counterparts. RecG helicase, which unwinds a variety of branched DNA molecules, such as Holliday junctions (HJ) and D-loops, plays important roles in DNA repair, recombination, and replication. Primary sequence analysis of RecG from a number of bacterial species revealed that three amino acids (QPW) in the DNA-binding wedge domain (WD) are well-conserved across the Deinococcus RecG proteins. Interactions involving these conserved residues and DNA substrates were predicted in modeled domain structures of D. radiodurans RecG (DrRecG). Compared to the WD of Escherichia coli RecG protein (EcRecG) containing FSA amino acids corresponding to QPW in DrRecG, the HJ binding activity of DrRecG-WD was higher than that of EcRecG-WD. Reciprocal substitution of FSA and QPW increased and decreased the HJ binding activity of the mutant WDs, EcRecG-WDQPW, and DrRecG-WDFSA, respectively. Following $\gamma$-irradiation treatment, the reduced survival rate of DrRecG mutants ($\Delta$recG) was fully restored by the expression of DrRecG, but not by that of EcRecG. EcRecGQPW also enhanced $\gamma$-radioresistance of $\Delta$recG, whereas DrRecGFSA did not. $\Delta$recG cells complemented in trans by DrRecG and EcRecGQPW reconstituted an intact genome within 3 h post-irradiation, as did the wild-type strain, but $\Delta$recG with EcRecG and DrRecGFSA exhibited a delay in assembly of chromosomal fragments induced by $\gamma$-irradiation. These results suggested that the QPW residues facilitate the association of DrRecG with DNA junctions, thereby enhancing the DNA repair efficiency of DrRecG.",

abstract = "The CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases have been widely applied for genome editing in various organisms. Cas9 nucleases complexed with a guide RNA (Cas9-gRNA) find their targets by scanning and interrogating the genomic DNA for sequences complementary to the gRNA. Recognition of the DNA target sequence requires a short protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) located outside this sequence. Given that the efficiency of target location may depend on the strength of interactions that promote target recognition, here we sought to compare affinities of different Cas9 nucleases for their cognate PAM sequences. To this end, we measured affinities of Cas9 nucleases from Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Francisella novicida complexed with guide RNAs (gRNAs) (SpCas9-gRNA, SaCas9-gRNA, and FnCas9-gRNA, respectively) and of three engineered SpCas9-gRNA variants with altered PAM specificities for short, PAM-containing DNA probes. We used a ``beacon'' assay that measures the relative affinities of DNA probes by determining their ability to competitively affect the rate of Cas9-gRNA binding to fluorescently labeled target DNA derivatives called ``Cas9 beacons.'' We observed significant differences in the affinities for cognate PAM sequences among the studied Cas9 enzymes. The relative affinities of SpCas9-gRNA and its engineered variants for canonical and suboptimal PAMs correlated with previous findings on the efficiency of these PAM sequences in genome editing. These findings suggest that high affinity of a Cas9 nuclease for its cognate PAM promotes higher genome-editing efficiency.",

Although some transgenic events showed simple insertions, others showed extreme genome damage in the form of chromosome truncations, large deletions, partial trisomy, and evidence of chromothripsis and breakage-fusion bridge cycling. Several transgenic events contained megabase-scale arrays of introduced DNA mixed with genomic fragments assembled by nonhomologous or microhomology-mediated joining. Damaged regions of the genome, assayed by the presence of small fragments displaced elsewhere, were often repaired without a trace, presumably by homology-dependent repair (HDR). The results suggest a model whereby successful biolistic transformation relies on a combination of end joining to insert foreign DNA and HDR to repair collateral damage caused by the microprojectiles. The differing levels of genome damage observed among transgenic events may reflect the stage of the cell cycle and the availability of templates for HDR.",

Our in planta particle bombardment (iPB) method utilizes the shoot apical meristem (SAM) as a target tissue.

It has been proposed that the nature of the DNA intermediates partly determines which polymerase is used for a particular repair reaction. To test this hypothesis, here we examine the ability of human Pol lambda to extend mismatched primer-termini, either on 'open' template-primer substrates, or on its preferred substrate, a 1 nt gapped-DNA molecule having a 5'-phosphate. Interestingly, Pol lambda extended mismatches with an average efficiency of approximately 10(-2) relative to matched base pairs. The match and mismatch extension catalytic efficiencies obtained on gapped molecules were approximately 260-fold higher than on template-primer molecules. A crystal structure of Pol lambda in complex with a single-nucleotide gap containing a dG.dGMP mismatch at the primer-terminus (2.40 A) suggests that, at least for certain mispairs, Pol lambda is unable to differentiate between matched and mismatched termini during the DNA binding step, thus accounting for the relatively high efficiency of mismatch extension. This property of Pol lambda suggests a potential role as a 'mismatch extender' during non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and possibly during translesion synthesis.",

Here, we report the transcriptional up-regulation of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtPol$\lambda$ in response to abiotic and genotoxic stress, including salinity and the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C (MMC). The increased sensitivity of atpol$\lambda$ knockout mutants toward high salinity and MMC treatments, with higher levels of accumulation of double strand breaks (DSBs) than wild-type plants and delayed repair of DSBs, has suggested the requirement of Pol $\lambda$ in DSB repair in plants. AtPol$\lambda$ overexpression moderately complemented the deficiency of DSB repair capacity in atpol$\lambda$ mutants. Transcriptional up-regulation of major nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway genes KU80, X-RAY CROSS COMPLEMENTATION PROTEIN4 (XRCC4), and DNA Ligase4 (Lig4) along with AtPol$\lambda$ in Arabidopsis seedlings, and the increased sensitivity of atpol$\lambda$-2/atxrcc4 and atpol$\lambda$-2/atlig4 double mutants toward high salinity and MMC treatments, indicated the involvement of NHEJ-mediated repair of salinity- and MMC-induced DSBs. The suppressed expression of NHEJ genes in atpol$\lambda$ mutants suggested complex transcriptional regulation of NHEJ genes. Pol $\lambda$ interacted directly with XRCC4 and Lig4 via its N-terminal breast cancer-associated C terminus (BRCT) domain in a yeast two-hybrid system, while increased sensitivity of BRCT-deficient Pol $\lambda$-expressing transgenic atpol$\lambda$-2 mutants toward genotoxins indicated the importance of the BRCT domain of AtPol$\lambda$ in mediating the interactions for processing DSBs.

DNA helicases are essential for unwinding this double strand when it comes to replication, repair or transcription of genetic information. In this review, we will focus on what is known about a variety of DNA helicases that are required to ensure genome stability in plants. Due to their sessile lifestyle, plants are especially exposed to harmful environmental factors. Moreover, many crop plants have large and highly repetitive genomes, making them absolutely dependent on the correct interplay of DNA helicases for safeguarding their stability. Although basic features of a number of these enzymes are conserved between plants and other eukaryotes, a more detailed analysis shows surprising peculiarities, partly also between different plant species. This is additionally of high relevance for plant breeding as a number of these helicases are also involved in crossover control during meiosis and influence the outcome of different approaches of CRISPR/Cas based plant genome engineering. Thus, gaining knowledge about plant helicases, their interplay, as well as the manipulation of their pathways, possesses the potential for improving agriculture. In the long run, this might even help us cope with the increasing obstacles of climate change threatening food security in completely new ways.",

We find that each of these repair/response defects negatively affects the preservation of the ends, resulting in an enhanced frequency of deletions, insertions, and inversions at the excision site. The spectra of the resulting repair products demonstrate, not unexpectedly, that the canonical nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) proteins DNA ligase IV and KU70 play an important role in the repair of the lesion generated by Ac excision. Our data also indicate that auxiliary NHEJ repair proteins such as DNA ligase VI and DNA polymerase lambda are routinely involved in the repair of these lesions.

In mammalian cells, the DNA polymerase (pol) family X enzyme DNA pol $\lambda$ catalyzes the correct incorporation of C opposite 8-oxo-G, together with the auxiliary factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Here, we show that Arabidopsis thaliana DNA pol $\lambda$, the only member of the X family in plants, is as efficient in performing error-free translesion synthesis past 8-oxo-G as its mammalian homolog. Arabidopsis, in contrast with animal cells, possesses two genes for PCNA. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we observed that PCNA2, but not PCNA1, physically interacts with DNA pol $\lambda$, enhancing its fidelity and efficiency in translesion synthesis. The levels of DNA pol $\lambda$ in transgenic plantlets characterized by overexpression or silencing of Arabidopsis POLL correlate with the ability of cell extracts to perform error-free translesion synthesis. The important role of DNA pol $\lambda$ is corroborated by the observation that the promoter of POLL is activated by UV and that both overexpressing and silenced plants show altered growth phenotypes.",

abstract = "Differences in the substrate specificity of mammalian family X DNA polymerases are proposed to partly depend on a loop (loop 1) upstream of the polymerase active site. To examine if this is the case in DNA polymerase $\lambda$ (pol $\lambda$), here we characterize a variant of the human polymerase in which nine residues of loop 1 are replaced with four residues from the equivalent position in pol $\beta$. Crystal structures of the mutant enzyme bound to gapped DNA with and without a correct dNTP reveal that the change in loop 1 does not affect the overall structure of the protein. Consistent with these structural data, the mutant enzyme has relatively normal catalytic efficiency for correct incorporation, and it efficiently participates in non-homologous end joining of double-strand DNA breaks. However, DNA junctions recovered from end-joining reactions are more diverse than normal, and the mutant enzyme is substantially less accurate than wild-type pol $\lambda$ in three different biochemical assays. Comparisons of the binary and ternary complex crystal structures of mutant and wild-type pol $\lambda$ suggest that loop 1 modulates pol $\lambda$'s fidelity by controlling dNTP-induced movements of the template strand and the primer-terminal 3'-OH as the enzyme transitions from an inactive to an active conformation.",

abstract = "Viral vectors are being engineered to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 components systemically in plants to induce somatic or heritable site-specific mutations. It is hypothesized that RNA mobility signals facilitate entry of viruses or single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) into the shoot apical meristem where germline mutations can occur. Our objective was to understand the impact of RNA mobility signals on virus-induced somatic and germline gene editing in Nicotiana benthamiana and Zea mays. Previously, we showed that foxtail mosaic virus (FoMV) expressing sgRNA induced somatic mutations in N. benthamiana and Z. mays expressing Cas9. Here, we fused RNA mobility signals to sgRNAs targeting the genes encoding either N. benthamiana phytoene desaturase (PDS) or Z. mays high affinity potassium transporter 1 (HKT1). Addition of Arabidopsis thaliana Flowering Locus T (AtFT) and A. thaliana tRNA-Isoleucine (AttRNAIle) did not improve FoMV-induced somatic editing, and neither were sufficient to facilitate germline mutations in N. benthamiana. Maize FT homologs, Centroradialus 16 (ZCN16) and ZCN19, as well as AttRNAIle were found to aid somatic editing in maize but did not enable sgRNAs delivered by FoMV to induce germline mutations. Additional viral guide RNA delivery systems were assessed for somatic and germline mutations in N. benthamiana with the intention of gaining a better understanding of the specificity of mobile signal-facilitated germline editing. Potato virus X (PVX), barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV), and tobacco rattle virus (TRV) were included in this comparative study, and all three of these viruses delivering sgRNA were able to induce somatic and germline mutations. Unexpectedly, PVX, a potexvirus closely related to FoMV, expressing sgRNA alone induced biallelic edited progeny, indicating that mobility signals are dispensable in virus-induced germline editing. These results show that PVX, BSMV, and TRV expressing sgRNA all have an innate ability to induce mutations in the germline. Our results indicate that mobility signals alone may not be sufficient to enable virus-based delivery of sgRNAs using the viruses, FoMV, PVX, BSMV, and TRV into cell types that result in germline mutations.",

In vertebrates, double-strand breaks are repaired predominantly by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which directly ligates DNA ends. NHEJ has the potential to be highly mutagenic because it uses DNA polymerases, nucleases, and other enzymes that modify incompatible DNA ends to allow their ligation. Using frog egg extracts that recapitulate NHEJ, we show that end processing requires the formation of a ``short-range synaptic complex'' in which DNA ends are closely aligned in a ligation-competent state. Furthermore, single-molecule imaging directly demonstrates that processing occurs within the short-range complex. This confinement of end processing to a ligation-competent complex ensures that DNA ends undergo ligation as soon as they become compatible, thereby minimizing mutagenesis. Our results illustrate how the coordination of enzymatic catalysis with higher-order structural organization of substrate maximizes the fidelity of DNA repair.",

Here, we report that disrupting CtIP or FANCD2, which have roles in alternative non-homologous end joining, enhances precise DNA-fragment deletion. By analyzing the inserted nucleotides at the junctions of DNA-fragment editing of deletions, inversions, and duplications and characterizing the cleaved products, we find that Cas9 endonucleolytically cleaves the noncomplementary strand with a flexible scissile profile upstream of the -3 position of the PAM site in vivo and in vitro, generating double-strand break ends with 5' overhangs of 1-3 nucleotides. Moreover, we find that engineered Cas9 nucleases have distinct cleavage profiles. Finally, Cas9-mediated nucleotide insertions are nonrandom and are equal to the combined sequences upstream of both PAM sites with predicted frequencies. Thus, precise and predictable DNA-fragment editing could be achieved by perturbing DNA repair genes and using appropriate PAM configurations.",

However, in the absence of these factors, cells still seem able to adequately maintain genome integrity, suggesting the presence of other b-NHEJ repair factors or pathways independent from KU and PARPs. The outcome of DSB repair by NHEJ pathways can be investigated by using artificial sequence-specific nucleases such as CRISPR/Cas9 to induce DSBs at a target of interest. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 for DSB induction at the Arabidopsis cruciferin 3 (CRU3) and protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) genes. DSB repair outcomes via NHEJ were analyzed using footprint analysis in wild-type plants and plants deficient in key factors of c-NHEJ (ku80), b-NHEJ (parp1 parp2), or both (ku80 parp1 parp2). We found that larger deletions of >20 bp predominated after DSB repair in ku80 and ku80 parp1 parp2 mutants, corroborating with a role of KU in preventing DSB end resection. Deletion lengths did not significantly differ between ku80 and ku80 parp1 parp2 mutants, suggesting that a KU- and PARP-independent b-NHEJ mechanism becomes active in these mutants. Furthermore, microhomologies and templated insertions were observed at the repair junctions in the wild type and all mutants. Since these characteristics are hallmarks of polymerase $\vartheta$-mediated DSB repair, we suggest a possible role for this recently discovered polymerase in DSB repair in plants.",

Since non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is usually considered to generate random indels, its high efficiency mutation is generally not pertinent to precise editing. Homology-directed repair (HDR) can mediate precise editing with supplied donor DNA, but it suffers from extreme low efficiency in higher plants. Therefore, precision editing in plants will be facilitated by the ability to predict NHEJ repair outcome and to improve HDR efficiency. Here, we report that NHEJ-mediated single nucleotide insertion at different rice genes is predictable based on DNA sequences at the target loci. Three mutation prediction tools (inDelphi, FORECasT, and SPROUT) have been validated in the rice plant system. We also evaluated the chimeric guide RNA (cgRNA) and Cas9-Retron precISe Parallel Editing via homologY (CRISPEY) strategies to facilitate donor template supply for improving HDR efficiency in Nicotiana benthamiana and rice. However, neither cgRNA nor CRISPEY improved plant HDR editing efficiency in this study.

However, if deployed in an inappropriate cellular context, these same repair functions can mediate chromosome rearrangements that underlie various human diseases, ranging from developmental disorders to cancer. The two major mechanisms of DSB repair in mammalian cells are non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination. In this Review, we consider DSB repair-pathway choice in somatic mammalian cells as a series of 'decision trees', and explore how defective pathway choice can lead to genomic instability. Stalled, collapsed or broken DNA replication forks present a distinctive challenge to the DSB repair system.

author = "Symington, Lorraine S",
abstract = "The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination (HR) is initiated by nucleolytic degradation of the 5'-terminated strands in a process termed end resection. End resection generates 3'-single-stranded DNA tails, substrates for Rad51 to catalyze homologous pairing and DNA strand exchange, and for activation of the DNA damage checkpoint. The commonly accepted view is that end resection occurs by a two-step mechanism. In the first step, Sae2/CtIP activates the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2/Nbs1 (MRX/N) complex to endonucleolytically cleave the 5'-terminated DNA strands close to break ends, and in the second step Exo1 and/or Dna2 nucleases extend the resected tracts to produce long 3'-ssDNA-tailed intermediates. Initiation of resection commits a cell to repair a DSB by HR because long ssDNA overhangs are poor substrates for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Thus, the initiation of end resection has emerged as a critical control point for repair pathway choice. Here, I review recent studies on the mechanism of end resection and how this process is regulated to ensure the most appropriate repair outcome.",

In vertebrates, double-strand breaks are repaired predominantly by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which directly ligates DNA ends. NHEJ has the potential to be highly mutagenic because it uses DNA polymerases, nucleases, and other enzymes that modify incompatible DNA ends to allow their ligation. Using frog egg extracts that recapitulate NHEJ, we show that end processing requires the formation of a ``short-range synaptic complex'' in which DNA ends are closely aligned in a ligation-competent state. Furthermore, single-molecule imaging directly demonstrates that processing occurs within the short-range complex. This confinement of end processing to a ligation-competent complex ensures that DNA ends undergo ligation as soon as they become compatible, thereby minimizing mutagenesis. Our results illustrate how the coordination of enzymatic catalysis with higher-order structural organization of substrate maximizes the fidelity of DNA repair.",

Several improvements have been made to increase mutagenesis efficiency, either through vector optimisation or the application of heat stress. RESULTS: Here, we present a simplified heat stress assay that can be completed in six days using commonly-available laboratory equipment. We show that three heat shocks (3xHS) efficiently increases indel efficiency of LbCas12a and Cas9, irrespective of the target sequence or the promoter used to express the nuclease. The generated indels are primarily somatic, but for three out of five targets we demonstrate that up to 25\% more biallelic mutations are transmitted to the progeny when heat is applied compared to non-heat controls. We also applied our heat treatment to lines containing CRISPR base editors and observed a 22-27\% increase in the percentage of C-to-T base editing. Furthermore, we test the effect of 3xHS on generating large deletions and a homologous recombination reporter. Interestingly, we observed no positive effect of 3xHS treatment on either approach using our conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our experiments show that heat treatment is consistently effective at increasing the number of somatic mutations using many CRISPR approaches in plants and in some cases can increase the recovery of mutant progeny.",

These enzymes have the fidelity and processivity required to replicate long DNA sequences, but DNA lesions can block their progression. Consequently, eukaryotic genomes also encode a variable number of specialized polymerases (between five and 16 depending on the organism) that are involved in the replication of damaged DNA, DNA repair, and organellar DNA replication. This diversity of enzymes likely stems from their ability to bypass specific types of lesions. In the past 10-15 years, our knowledge regarding plant DNA polymerases dramatically increased. In this review, we discuss these recent findings and compare acquired knowledge in plants to data obtained in other eukaryotes.

OsPol lambda had activities of DNA polymerase, terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase and deoxyribose phosphate lyase, a marker enzyme for base excision repair. It also interacted with rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen (OsPCNA) in a pull-down assay. OsPCNA increased the processivity of OsPol lambda. Northern blot analysis showed that the level of OsPol lambda expression correlated with cell proliferation in meristematic and meiotic tissues, and was induced by DNA-damaging treatments.

Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is a prominent DSB repair pathway, which has long been considered to be error-prone. However, recent data have pointed to the intrinsic precision of NHEJ. Three reasons can account for the apparent fallibility of NHEJ: 1) the existence of a highly error-prone alternative end-joining process; 2) the adaptability of canonical C-NHEJ (Ku- and Xrcc4/ligase IV-dependent) to imperfect complementary ends; and 3) the requirement to first process chemically incompatible DNA ends that cannot be ligated directly. Thus, C-NHEJ is conservative but adaptable, and the accuracy of the repair is dictated by the structure of the DNA ends rather than by the C-NHEJ machinery. We present data from different organisms that describe the conservative/versatile properties of C-NHEJ. The advantages of the adaptability/versatility of C-NHEJ are discussed for the development of the immune repertoire and the resistance to ionizing radiation, especially at low doses, and for targeted genome manipulation.",

We then employed a CRISPR-Cas-enabled advanced breeding technology to generate novel variants of ARGOS8. The native maize GOS2 promoter, which confers a moderate level of constitutive expression, was inserted into the 5'-untranslated region of the native ARGOS8 gene or was used to replace the native promoter of ARGOS8. Precise genomic DNA modification at the ARGOS8 locus was verified by PCR and sequencing. The ARGOS8 variants had elevated levels of ARGOS8 transcripts relative to the native allele and these transcripts were detectable in all the tissues tested, which was the expected results using the GOS2 promoter.

Here, we describe CRISPRpath, a scalable screening strategy for parallelly characterizing CREs of genes linked to the same biological pathway and converging phenotypes. We demonstrate the ability of CRISPRpath for simultaneously identifying functional enhancers of six genes in the 6-thioguanine--induced DNA mismatch repair pathway using both CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR nuclease (CRISPRn) approaches. Sixty percent of the identified enhancers are known promoters with distinct epigenomic features compared to other active promoters, including increased chromatin accessibility and interactivity. Furthermore, by imposing different levels of selection pressure, CRISPRpath can distinguish enhancers exerting strong impact on gene expression from those exerting weak impact. Our results offer a nuanced view of cis-regulation and demonstrate that CRISPRpath can be leveraged for understanding the complex gene regulatory program beyond transcriptional output at scale.",

Here, we engineered over 60 promoter alleles in two tomato fruit size genes3,4 to characterize cis-regulatory sequences and study their functional relationships. We found that targeted mutations in conserved promoter sequences of SlCLV3, a repressor of stem cell proliferation5,6, have a weak impact on fruit locule number. Pairwise combinations of these mutations mildly enhance this phenotype, revealing additive and synergistic relationships between conserved regions and further suggesting even higher-order cis-regulatory interactions within the SlCLV3 promoter. In contrast, SlWUS, a positive regulator of stem cell proliferation repressed by SlCLV3 (refs. 5,6), is more tolerant to promoter perturbations. Our results show that complex interplay among cis-regulatory variants can shape quantitative variation, and suggest that empirical dissections of this hidden complexity can guide promoter engineering to predictably modify crop traits.",

Natural genetic changes in cis-regulatory regions of genes play important roles in shaping phenotypic diversity by altering their expression. Utilization of CRISPR/Cas editing in crop species can accelerate crop improvement through the introduction of genetic variation in a targeted manner. The advent of CRISPR/Cas-mediated cis-regulatory region engineering (cis-engineering) provides a more refined method for modulating gene expression and creating phenotypic diversity to benefit crop improvement. Here, we focus on the current applications of CRISPR/Cas-mediated cis-engineering in horticultural crops. We describe strategies and limitations for its use in crop improvement, including de novo cis-regulatory element (CRE) discovery, precise genome editing, and transgene-free genome editing. In addition, we discuss the challenges and prospects regarding current technologies and achievements.

We recently showed that tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (Tdp1) regulates the accuracy of NHEJ repair junction formation in yeast. We assessed the role of other enzymes in the accuracy of junction formation using a plasmid repair assay. We found that exonuclease 1 (Exo1) is important in assuring accurate junction formation during NHEJ. Like tdp1$\Delta$ mutants, exo1$\Delta$ yeast cells repairing plasmids with 5'-extensions can produce repair junctions with templated insertions. We also found that exo1$\Delta$ mutants have a reduced median size of deletions when joining DNA with blunt ends. Surprisingly, exo1$\Delta$ pol4$\Delta$ mutants repair blunt ends with a very low frequency of deletions. This result suggests that there are multiple pathways that process blunt ends prior to end-joining. We propose that Exo1 acts at a late stage in end-processing during NHEJ. Exo1 can reverse nucleotide additions occurring due to polymerization, and may also be important for processing ends to expose microhomologies needed for NHEJ. We propose that accurate joining is controlled at two steps, a first step that blocks modification of DNA ends, which requires Tdp1, and a second step that occurs after synapsis that requires Exo1.",

abstract = "CRISPR-Cas9 is the state-of-the-art technology for editing and manipulating nucleic acids. However, the occurrence of off-target mutations can limit its applicability. Here, all-atom enhanced molecular dynamics (MD) simulations-using Gaussian accelerated MD (GaMD)-are used to decipher the mechanism of off-target binding at the molecular level. GaMD reveals that base pair mismatches in the target DNA at distal sites with respect to the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) can induce an extended opening of the RNA:DNA heteroduplex, which leads to newly formed interactions between the unwound DNA and the L2 loop of the catalytic HNH domain. These conserved interactions constitute a ``lock'' effectively decreasing the conformational freedom of the HNH domain and hampering its activation for cleavage. Remarkably, depending on their positions at PAM distal sites, DNA mismatches responsible for off-target cleavages are unable to ``lock'' the HNH domain, thereby leading to the unselective cleavage of DNA sequences. In consistency with the available experimental data, the ability to ``lock'' the catalytic HNH domain in an inactive ``conformational checkpoint'' is shown to be a key determinant in the onset of off-target effects. This mechanistic rationale contributes in clarifying a long lasting open issue in the CRISPR-Cas9 function and poses the foundation for designing novel and more specific Cas9 variants, which could be obtained by magnifying the ``locking'' interactions between HNH and the target DNA in the presence of any incorrect off-target sequence, thus preventing undesired cleavages.",

Therefore, based on one- and two-metal-ion mechanisms, homology modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation are suitable tools for building an atomic model of Cas9 in the DNA cleavage state. Here, by modeling and MD, we presented an atomic model of SpCas9-sgRNA-DNA complex with the cleavage state. This model shows that the HNH and RuvC conformations resemble their DNA cleavage state where the active-sites in the complex coordinate with DNA, Mg2+ ions, and water. Among them, residues D10, E762, H983, and D986 locate at the first shell of the RuvC active-site and interact with the ions directly, residues H982 or/and H985 are general (Lewis) bases, and the coordinated water is located at the positions for nucleophilic attack of the scissile phosphate. Meanwhile, this catalytic model led us to engineer a new SpCas9 variant (SpCas9-H982A + H983D) with reduced off-target effects.

Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated repair of DSBs, on the other hand, has been utilized for the induction of site-specific mutagenesis in plants. Since NHEJ is the dominant DSB repair pathway and can also lead to the capture of foreign DNA molecules, we suggest that it can also be deployed for gene replacement. An acceptor DNA molecule in which a green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding sequence (gfp) was flanked by ZFN recognition sequences was used to produce transgenic target plants. A donor DNA molecule in which a promoterless hygromycin B phosphotransferase-encoding gene (hpt) was flanked by ZFN recognition sequences was constructed. The donor DNA molecule and ZFN expression cassette were delivered into target plants. ZFN-mediated site-specific mutagenesis and complete removal of the GFP coding sequence resulted in the recovery of hygromycin-resistant plants that no longer expressed GFP and in which the hpt gene was unlinked to the acceptor DNA. More importantly, ZFN-mediated digestion of both donor and acceptor DNA molecules resulted in NHEJ-mediated replacement of the gfp with hpt and recovery of hygromycin-resistant plants that no longer expressed GFP and in which the hpt gene was physically linked to the acceptor DNA. Sequence and phenotypical analyses, and transmission of the replacement events to the next generation, confirmed the stability of the NHEJ-induced gene exchange, suggesting its use as a novel method for transgene replacement and gene stacking in plants.",

Such donors typically contain two approximately 750 bp regions of chromosomal sequence required for homology-directed DNA repair. Here, we demonstrate that easily-generated linear donors with extremely short (50 bp) homology regions drive transgene integration into 5-10\% of chromosomes. Moreover, we measure the overhangs produced by ZFN cleavage and find that oligonucleotide donors with single-stranded 5' overhangs complementary to those made by ZFNs are efficiently ligated in vivo to the DSB. Greater than 10\% of all chromosomes directly incorporate this exogenous DNA via a process that is dependent upon and guided by complementary 5' overhangs on the donor DNA. Finally, we extend this non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-based technique by directly inserting donor DNA comprising recombinase sites into large deletions created by the simultaneous action of two separate ZFN pairs. Up to 50\% of deletions contained a donor insertion.

Here, we show that HOS1 induces FLC expression by antagonizing the actions of FVE and its interacting partner histone deacetylase 6 (HDA6) under short-term cold stress. HOS1 binds to FLC chromatin in an FVE-dependent manner, and FVE is essential for the HOS1-mediated activation of FLC transcription. HOS1 also interacts with HDA6 and inhibits the binding of HDA6 to FLC chromatin. Intermittent cold treatments induce FLC expression by activating HOS1, which attenuates the activity of HDA6 in silencing FLC chromatin, and the effects of intermittent cold are diminished in hos1 and fve mutants.

abstract = "Heat stress limits plant growth, development, and crop yield, but how plant cells precisely sense and transduce heat stress signals remains elusive. Here, we identified a conserved heat stress response mechanism to elucidate how heat stress signal is transmitted from the cytoplasm into the nucleus for epigenetic modifiers. We demonstrate that HISTONE DEACETYLASE 9 (HDA9) transduces heat signals from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to play a positive regulatory role in heat responses in Arabidopsis. Heat specifically induces HDA9 accumulation in the nucleus. Under heat stress, the phosphatase PP2AB'$\beta$ directly interacts with and dephosphorylates HDA9 to protect HDA9 from 26S proteasome-mediated degradation, leading to the translocation of nonphosphorylated HDA9 to the nucleus. This heat-induced enrichment of HDA9 in the nucleus depends on the nucleoporin HOS1. In the nucleus, HDA9 binds and deacetylates the target genes related to signaling transduction and plant development to repress gene expression in a transcription factor YIN YANG 1-dependent and -independent manner, resulting in rebalance of plant development and heat response. Therefore, we uncover an HDA9-mediated positive regulatory module in the heat shock signal transduction pathway. More important, this cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation of HDA9 in response to heat stress is conserved in wheat and rice, which confers the mechanism significant implication potential for crop breeding to cope with global climate warming.",

The deleterious effects of heat shock on cell function include misfolding of cellular proteins, disruption of cytoskeletons and membranes, and disordering of RNA metabolism and genome integrity3-5. Plants stimulate diverse heat shock response pathways in response to abrupt temperature increases. While it is known that stressful high temperatures disturb genome integrity by causing nucleotide modifications and strand breakages or impeding DNA repair6, it is largely unexplored how plants cope with heat-induced DNA damages. Here, we demonstrated that high expression of osmotically reponsive genes 1 (HOS1) induces thermotolerance by activating DNA repair components. Thermotolerance and DNA repair capacity were substantially reduced in HOS1-deficient mutants, in which thermal induction of genes encoding DNA repair systems, such as the DNA helicase RECQ2, was markedly decreased. Notably, HOS1 proteins were thermostabilized in a heat shock factor A1/heat shock protein 90 (HSP90)-dependent manner.

The orthogonal DNA replication system (OrthoRep) in yeast can efficiently mutate long DNA fragments in an easy-to-operate manner. However, such a system is lacking in bacteria. Therefore, we developed a bacterial orthogonal DNA replication system (BacORep) for continuous evolution. We achieved this by harnessing the temperate phage GIL16 DNA replication machinery in Bacillus thuringiensis with an engineered error-prone orthogonal DNA polymerase. BacORep introduces all 12 types of nucleotide substitution in 15-kilobase genes on orthogonally replicating linear plasmids with a 6,700-fold higher mutation rate than that of the host genome, the mutation rate of which is unchanged. Here we demonstrate the utility of BacORep-based continuous evolution by generating strong promoters applicable to model bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli, and achieving a 7.4-fold methanol assimilation increase in B. thuringiensis. BacORep is a powerful tool for continuous evolution in prokaryotic cells.",

abstract = "Repair of DNA double strand breaks by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) requires enzymatic processing beyond simple ligation when the terminal bases are damaged or not fully compatible. We transformed yeast with a series of linearized plasmids to examine the role of Pol4 (Pol IV, DNA polymerase beta) in repair at a variety of end configurations. Mutation of POL4 did not impair DNA polymerase-independent religation of fully compatible ends and led to at most a 2-fold reduction in the frequency of joins that require only DNA polymerization. In contrast, the frequency of joins that also required removal of a 5'- or 3'-terminal mismatch was markedly reduced in pol4 (but not rev3, exo1, apn1, or rad1) yeast. In a chromosomal double strand break assay, pol4 mutation conferred a marked increase in sensitivity to HO endonuclease in a rad52 background, due primarily to loss of an NHEJ event that anneals with a 3'-terminal mismatch. The NHEJ activity of Pol4 was dependent on its nucleotidyl transferase function, as well as its unique amino terminus. Paradoxically, in vitro analyses with oligonucleotide substrates demonstrated that although Pol4 fills gaps with displacement of mismatched but not matched 5' termini, it lacks both 5'- and 3'-terminal nuclease activities. Pol4 is thus specifically recruited to perform gap-filling in an NHEJ pathway that must also involve as yet unidentified nucleases.",

Here we show that Pol4 preferentially catalyzes DNA synthesis on small gaps formed by the alignment of linear duplex DNA molecules with complementary ends, a DNA substrate specificity that is compatible with its predicted role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Pol4 also interacts directly with the Dnl4 subunit of the Dnl4-Lif1 complex via its N-terminal BRCT domain. This interaction stimulates the DNA synthesis activity of Pol4 and, to a lesser extent, the DNA joining activity of Dnl4-Lif1. Notably, the joining of DNA substrates that require the combined action of Pol4 and Dnl4-Lif1 is much more efficient than the joining of similar DNA substrates that require only ligation. Thus, the physical and functional interactions between Pol4 and Dnl4-Lif1 provide a molecular mechanism for both the recruitment of Pol4 to in vivo DNA double-strand breaks and the coupling of the gap filling DNA synthesis and DNA joining reactions that complete the microhomology-mediated pathway of nonhomologous end joining.",

abstract = "Exonuclease 1, a class III member of the RAD2 nuclease family, is a structure-specific nuclease involved in DNA metabolism (replication, repair and recombination). We have identified a homologue to Exonuclease-1 from rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) and have designated it O. sativa Exonuclease-1 (OsEXO1). The open reading frame of OsEXO1 encodes a predicted product of 836 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 92 kDa. Two highly conserved nuclease domains (XPG-N and XPG-I) are present in the N-terminal region of the protein. OsEXO1-sGFP fusion protein transiently overexpressed in the onion epidermal cells localized to the nucleus. The transcript of OsEXO1 is highly expressed in meristematic tissues and panicles. Inhibition of cell proliferation by removal of sucrose from the medium or by the addition of cell cycle inhibitors decreased OsEXO1 expression. Functional complementation assays using yeast RAD2 member null mutants demonstrates that OsEXO1 is able to substitute for ScEXO1 and ScRAD27 functions. Yeast two-hybrid analysis shows that OsEXO1 interacted with rice DNA polymerase lambda (OsPol lambda), the 70 kDa subunit b of rice replication protein A (OsRPA70b), and the 32 kDa subunit 1 of rice replication protein A (OsRPA32-1). Irradiation of UV-B induces OsEXO1 expression while hydrogen peroxide treatment represses it. These results suggest that OsEXO1 plays an important role in both cell proliferation and UV-damaged nuclear DNA repair pathway under dark conditions.",

As a result, finding adequate target sequences that meet the specificities of a given Cas nuclease on any gene of interest remains challenging in many cases. To assess target site flexibility, we tested five different Cas9/Cas12a endonucleases (SpCas9, SaCas9, St1Cas9, Mb3Cas12a, and AsCas12a) in embryogenic rice calli from Taipei 309 at 37°C (optimal temperature for most Cas9/Cas12a proteins) and 27°C (optimal temperature for tissue culture) and measured their editing rates under regular tissue culture conditions using Illumina sequencing. StCas9 and AsCas12 were not functional as tested, regardless of the temperature used. SpCas9 was the most efficient endonuclease at either temperature, regardless of whether monoallelic or biallelic edits were considered. Mb3Cas12a at 37°C was the next most efficient endonuclease. Monoallelic edits prevailed for both SaCas9 and Mb3Cas12a at 27°C, but biallelic edits prevailed at 37°C. Overall, the use of other Cas9 orthologs, the use of Cas12a endonucleases, and the optimal temperature can expand the range of targetable sequences.",

abstract = "Endosomal trafficking plays an important role in regulating plant growth and development both at optimal and stressed conditions. Cold stress response in Arabidopsis root is directly linked to inhibition of the endosomal trafficking of auxin efflux carriers. However, the cellular components that link cold stress and the endosomal trafficking remain elusive. By screening available endosomal trafficking mutants against root growth recovery response under cold stress, we identified GNOM, a SEC7 containing ARF-GEF, as a major modulator of cold response. Contrasting response of partial loss of function mutant gnomB4049/emb30-1 and the engineered Brefeldin A (BFA)-resistant GNOM line, both of which contain mutations within SEC7 domain, to cold stress at the whole-plant level highlights the importance of this domain in modulating the cold response pathway of plants. Cold stress selectively and transiently inhibits GNOM expression. The engineered point mutation at 696 amino acid position (Methionine to Leucine) that makes GNOM resistant to BFA in fact results in overexpression of GNOM both at transcriptional and translational levels, and also alters its subcellular localization. Overexpression and altered cellular localization of GNOM were found to be directly linked to conferring striking cold-resistant phenotype in Arabidopsis. Collectively, these results provide a mechanistic link between GNOM, BFA-sensitive GNOM-regulated trafficking and cold stress.",

Here we used kinetics-guided cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of Cas9 at different stages of mismatch cleavage. We observed a distinct, linear conformation of the guide RNA-DNA duplex formed in the presence of mismatches, which prevents Cas9 activation. Although the canonical kinked guide RNA-DNA duplex conformation facilitates DNA cleavage, we observe that substrates that contain mismatches distal to the protospacer adjacent motif are stabilized by reorganization of a loop in the RuvC domain. Mutagenesis of mismatch-stabilizing residues reduces off-target DNA cleavage but maintains rapid on-target DNA cleavage. By targeting regions that are exclusively involved in mismatch tolerance, we provide a proof of concept for the design of next-generation high-fidelity Cas9 variants.",

Jinek et al. (p. 816, published online 28 June; see the Perspective by Brouns) found that for the type II CRISPR/Cas system, the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) as well as the trans-activating crRNA---which is known to be involved in the pre-crRNA processing---were both required to direct the Cas9 endonuclease to cleave the invading target DNA. Furthermore, engineered RNA molecules were able to program the Cas9 endonuclease to cleave specific DNA sequences to generate double-stranded DNA breaks. A prokaryotic RNA--directed targeting system can be designed to cleave any DNA sequence. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity against viruses and plasmids by using CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to guide the silencing of invading nucleic acids. We show here that in a subset of these systems, the mature crRNA that is base-paired to trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) forms a two-RNA structure that directs the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 to introduce double-stranded (ds) breaks in target DNA. At sites complementary to the crRNA-guide sequence, the Cas9 HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand, whereas the Cas9 RuvC-like domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand. The dual-tracrRNA:crRNA, when engineered as a single RNA chimera, also directs sequence-specific Cas9 dsDNA cleavage. Our study reveals a family of endonucleases that use dual-RNAs for site-specific DNA cleavage and highlights the potential to exploit the system for RNA-programmable genome editing.",

abstract = "The Drosophila element Mos1 is a class II transposon, which moves by a ?cut-and-paste? mechanism and can be experimentally mobilized in the Caenorhabditis elegans germ line. Here, we triggered the excision of identified Mos1 insertions to create chromosomal breaks at given sites and further manipulate the broken loci. Double-strand break (DSB) repair could be achieved by gene conversion using a transgene containing sequences homologous to the broken chromosomal region as a repair template. Consequently, mutations engineered in the transgene could be copied to a specific locus at high frequency. This pathway was further characterized to develop an efficient tool?called MosTIC?to manipulate the C. elegans genome. Analysis of DSB repair during MosTIC experiments demonstrated that DSBs could also be sealed by end-joining in the germ line, independently from the evolutionarily conserved Ku80 and ligase IV factors. In conjunction with a publicly available Mos1 insertion library currently being generated, MosTIC will provide a general tool to customize the C. elegans genome.",

We report here that a Drosophila mutagen-sensitive mutant, mus3O9, contains a mutation in IRBP (inverted repeat binding protein), the Drosophila homolog of the mammalian Ku p70 gene. We show that the repair of double-strand DNA breaks after P-element excision is severely reduced in mus3O9 mutants using an in vivo assay for P-element transposase activity. In addition, excision products recovered from mus3O9 mutant embryos by use of a plasmid-based P-element mobility assay contain large deletions, suggesting that IRBP is involved in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks. Our findings provide the first demonstration that a mutation in the IRBP gene affects double-strand DNA break repair and suggest that DNA repair functions are conserved between Drosophila and mammals.",

author = "Kumar, Jitesh and Char, Si Nian and Weiss, Trevor and Liu, Hua and Liu, Bo and Yang, Bing and Zhang, Feng",
abstract = "Efficient and precise targeted insertion holds great promise but remains challenging in plant genome editing. An efficient non-homologous end-joining-mediated targeted insertion method was recently developed by combining CRISPR/SpCas9 gene editing with phosphorothioate modified double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (dsODNs). Yet this approach often leads to imprecise insertions with no control over the insertion direction. Here, we compared the influence of chemical protection of dsODNs on efficiency of targeted insertion. We observed that CRISPR/SpCas9 frequently induced staggered cleavages with 1-nucleotide 5´overhangs; we also evaluated the effect of donor end structures on the direction and precision of targeted insertions. We demonstrate that chemically protected dsODNs with 1-nucleotide 5´ overhangs significantly improved the precision and direction control of target insertions in all tested CRISPR targeted sites. We applied this method to endogenous gene tagging in green foxtail (Setaria viridis), and engineering of cis-regulatory elements for disease resistance in rice (Oryza sativa). We directionally inserted two distinct transcription activator-like effector binding elements into the promoter region of a recessive rice bacterial blight resistance gene with up to 24.4\% efficiency. The resulting rice lines harboring heritable insertions exhibited strong resistance to infection by the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in an inducible and strain-specific manner.",

abstract = "Here, we have investigated the physical and molecular basis of stability of Arabidopsis DNA Pol $\lambda$, the sole X family DNA polymerase member in plant genome, under UV-B and salinity stress in connection with the function of the N-terminal BRCT (breast cancer-associated C terminus) domain and Ser-Pro rich region in the regulation of the overall structure of this protein. Tryptophan fluorescence studies, fluorescence quenching and Bis-ANS binding experiments using purified recombinant full length Pol $\lambda$ and its N-terminal deletion forms have revealed UV-B induced conformational change in BRCT domain deficient Pol $\lambda$. On the other hand, the highly conserved C-terminal catalytic core PolX domain maintained its tertiary folds under similar condition. Circular dichroism (CD) and fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectral studies have indicated appreciable change in the secondary structural elements in UV-B exposed BRCT domain deficient Pol $\lambda$. Increased thermodynamic stability of the C-terminal catalytic core domain suggested destabilizing effect of the N-terminal Ser-Pro rich region on the protein structure. Urea-induced equilibrium unfolding studies have revealed increased stability of Pol $\lambda$ and its N-terminal deletion mutants at high NaCl concentration. In vivo aggregation studies using transient expression systems in Arabidopsis and tobacco indicated possible aggregation of Pol $\lambda$ lacking the BRCT domain. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed interaction of Pol $\lambda$ with the eukaryotic molecular chaperone HSP90, suggesting the possibility of regulation of Pol $\lambda$ stability by HSP90 in plant cell. Overall, our results have provided one of the first comprehensive information on the biophysical characteristics of Pol $\lambda$ and indicated the importance of both BRCT and Ser-Pro rich modules in regulating the stability of this protein under genotoxic stress in plants.",

abstract = "DNA polymerase lambda (Pol lambda) is a member of the Pol X family having properties in common with several other mammalian DNA polymerases. To obtain clues to possible functions in vivo, we have determined the fidelity of DNA synthesis by human Pol lambda. The results indicate that the average single-base deletion error rate of Pol lambda is higher than those of other mammalian polymerases. In fact, unlike other DNA polymerases, Pol lambda generates single-base deletions at average rates that substantially exceed base substitution rates. Moreover, the sequence specificity for single-base deletions made by Pol lambda is different from that of other DNA polymerases and reveals that Pol lambda readily uses template-primers with limited base pair homology at the primer terminus. This ability, together with an ability to fill short gaps in DNA at low dNTP concentrations, is consistent with a role for mammalian Pol lambda in non-homologous end-joining. This may include non-homologous end-joining of strand breaks resulting from DNA damage, because Pol lambda has intrinsic 5',2'-deoxyribose-5-phosphate lyase activity.",

abstract = "Resting cells experience mutations without apparent external mutagenic influences. Such DNA replication-independent mutations are suspected to be a consequence of processing of spontaneous DNA lesions. Using experimental systems based on reversions of frameshift alleles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we evaluated the impact of defects in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair on the frequency of replication-independent mutations. The deletion of the genes coding for Ku70 or DNA ligase IV, which are both obligatory constituents of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, each resulted in a 50\% reduction of replication-independent mutation frequency in haploid cells. Sequencing indicated that typical NHEJ-dependent reversion events are small deletions within mononucleotide repeats, with a remarkable resemblance to DNA polymerase slippage errors. Experiments with diploid and RAD52- or RAD54-deficient strains confirmed that among DSB repair pathways only NHEJ accounts for a considerable fraction of replication-independent frameshift mutations in haploid and diploid NHEJ non-repressed cells. Thus our results provide evidence that G(0) cells with unrepressed NHEJ capacity pay for a large-scale chromosomal stability with an increased frequency of small-scale mutations, a finding of potential relevance for carcinogenesis.",

title = "Cell cycle and genetic requirements of two pathways of nonhomologous end-joining repair of double-strand breaks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae",
author = "Moore, J K and Haber, J E",
abstract = "In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an HO endonuclease-induced double-strand break can be repaired by at least two pathways of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) that closely resemble events in mammalian cells. In one pathway the chromosome ends are degraded to yield deletions with different sizes whose endpoints have 1 to 6 bp of homology. Alternatively, the 4-bp overhanging 3' ends of HO-cut DNA (5'-AACA-3') are not degraded but can be base paired in misalignment to produce +CA and +ACA insertions. When HO was expressed throughout the cell cycle, the efficiency of NHEJ repair was 30 times higher than when HO was expressed only in G1. The types of repair events were also very different when HO was expressed throughout the cell cycle; 78\% of survivors had small insertions, while almost none had large deletions. When HO expression was confined to the G1 phase, only 21\% were insertions and 38\% had large deletions. These results suggest that there are distinct mechanisms of NHEJ repair producing either insertions or deletions and that these two pathways are differently affected by the time in the cell cycle when HO is expressed. The frequency of NHEJ is unaltered in strains from which RAD1, RAD2, RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, or RAD57 is deleted; however, deletions of RAD50, XRS2, or MRE11 reduced NHEJ by more than 70-fold when HO was not cell cycle regulated. Moreover, mutations in these three genes markedly reduced +CA insertions, while significantly increasing the proportion of both small (-ACA) and larger deletion events. In contrast, the rad5O mutation had little effect on the viability of G1-induced cells but significantly reduced the frequency of both +CA insertions and -ACA deletions in favor of larger deletions. Thus, RAD50 (and by extension XRS2 and MRE11) exerts a much more important role in the insertion-producing pathway of NHEJ repair found in S and/or G2 than in the less frequent deletion events that predominate when HO is expressed only in G1.",

title = "Rejoining of {DNA} double-strand breaks as a function of overhang length",
author = "Daley, James M and Wilson, Thomas E",
abstract = "The ends of spontaneously occurring double-strand breaks (DSBs) may contain various lengths of single-stranded DNA, blocking lesions, and gaps and flaps generated by end annealing. To investigate the processing of such structures, we developed an assay in which annealed oligonucleotides are ligated onto the ends of a linearized plasmid which is then transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Reconstitution of a marker occurs only when the oligonucleotides are incorporated and repair is in frame, permitting rapid analysis of complex DSB ends. Here, we created DSBs with compatible overhangs of various lengths and asked which pathways are required for their precise repair. Three mechanisms of rejoining were observed, regardless of overhang polarity: nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), a Rad52-dependent single-strand annealing-like pathway, and a third mechanism independent of the first two mechanisms. DSBs with overhangs of less than 4 bases were mainly repaired by NHEJ. Repair became less dependent on NHEJ when the overhangs were longer or had a higher GC content. Repair of overhangs greater than 8 nucleotides was as much as 150-fold more efficient, impaired 10-fold by rad52 mutation, and highly accurate. Reducing the microhomology extent between long overhangs reduced their repair dramatically, to less than NHEJ of comparable short overhangs. These data support a model in which annealing energy is a primary determinant of the rejoining efficiency and mechanism.",
