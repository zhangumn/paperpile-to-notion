abstract = "DNA double-strand breaks can be repaired through ligation-based pathways (non-homologous end-joining) or replication-based pathways (homologous recombination) in eukaryotic cells. The decisions that govern these outcomes are widely viewed as a competition between factors that recognize DNA ends and physically promote association of factors specific to each pathway, commonly known as 'pathway choice'. Here I review recent results in the literature and propose that this decision is better described as a sequential set of binding and end processing events, with non-homologous end joining as the first decision point. Physical association and co-localization of end resection factors with non-homologous end-joining factors suggests that ends are transferred between these complexes, thus the ultimate outcome is not the result of a competition but is more akin to a relay race that is determined by the efficiency of the initial end-joining event and the availability of activated DNA end-processing enzymes.",

To address this, we evaluate multiple compensation voltage (CV) high field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMSpro) settings using the latest label-free single-shot Orbitrap-based DIA acquisition workflows for their ability to deeply quantify the Arabidopsis thaliana seedling proteome. Using a BoxCarDIA acquisition workflow with a -30 -50 -70 CV FAIMSpro setting, we were able to consistently quantify >5000 Arabidopsis seedling proteins over a 21-min gradient, facilitating the analysis of ∼42 samples per day. Utilizing this acquisition approach, we then quantified proteome-level changes occurring in Arabidopsis seedling shoots and roots over 24 h of salt and osmotic stress, to identify early and late stress response proteins and reveal stress response overlaps. Here, we successfully quantify >6400 shoot and >8500 root protein groups, respectively, quantifying nearly ∼9700 unique protein groups in total across the study. Collectively, we pioneer a short gradient, multi-CV FAIMSpro BoxCarDIA acquisition workflow that represents an exciting new analysis approach for undertaking quantitative proteomic time-course experimentation in plants.",

abstract = "DNA polymerase lambda (Pol lambda) is one of several DNA polymerases suggested to participate in base excision repair (BER), in repair of broken DNA ends and in translesion synthesis. It has been proposed that the nature of the DNA intermediates partly determines which polymerase is used for a particular repair reaction. To test this hypothesis, here we examine the ability of human Pol lambda to extend mismatched primer-termini, either on 'open' template-primer substrates, or on its preferred substrate, a 1 nt gapped-DNA molecule having a 5'-phosphate. Interestingly, Pol lambda extended mismatches with an average efficiency of approximately 10(-2) relative to matched base pairs. The match and mismatch extension catalytic efficiencies obtained on gapped molecules were approximately 260-fold higher than on template-primer molecules. A crystal structure of Pol lambda in complex with a single-nucleotide gap containing a dG.dGMP mismatch at the primer-terminus (2.40 A) suggests that, at least for certain mispairs, Pol lambda is unable to differentiate between matched and mismatched termini during the DNA binding step, thus accounting for the relatively high efficiency of mismatch extension. This property of Pol lambda suggests a potential role as a 'mismatch extender' during non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and possibly during translesion synthesis.",

abstract = "It is of pivotal importance for genome stability that repair DNA polymerases (Pols), such as Pols $\lambda$ and $\beta$, which all exhibit considerably reduced fidelity when replicating undamaged DNA, are tightly regulated, because their misregulation could lead to mutagenesis. Recently, we found that the correct repair of the abundant and highly miscoding oxidative DNA lesion 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanine (8-oxo-G) is performed by an accurate repair pathway that is coordinated by the MutY glycosylase homologue (MutYH) and Pol $\lambda$ in vitro and in vivo. Pol $\lambda$ is phosphorylated by Cdk2/cyclinA in late S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, promoting Pol $\lambda$ stability by preventing it from being targeted for proteasomal degradation by ubiquitination. However, it has remained a mystery how the levels of Pol $\lambda$ are controlled, how phosphorylation promotes its stability, and how the engagement of Pol $\lambda$ in active repair complexes is coordinated. Here, we show that the E3 ligase Mule mediates the degradation of Pol $\lambda$ and that the control of Pol $\lambda$ levels by Mule has functional consequences for the ability of mammalian cells to deal with 8-oxo-G lesions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Pol $\lambda$ by Cdk2/cyclinA counteracts its Mule-mediated degradation by promoting recruitment of Pol $\lambda$ to chromatin into active 8-oxo-G repair complexes through an increase in Pol $\lambda$'s affinity to chromatin-bound MutYH. Finally, MutYH appears to promote the stability of Pol $\lambda$ by binding it to chromatin. In contrast, Pol $\lambda$ not engaged in active repair on chromatin is subject for proteasomal degradation.",

Here, we demonstrate that the A-family polymerase theta (POLQ) is a major driver of inheritable genomic alterations in Caenorhabditis elegans. Unlike somatic cells, which use non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to repair DNA transposon-induced DSBs, germ cells use polymerase theta-mediated end joining, a conceptually simple repair mechanism requiring only one nucleotide as a template for repair. Also CRISPR/Cas9-induced genomic changes are exclusively generated through polymerase theta-mediated end joining, refuting a previously assumed requirement for NHEJ in their formation. Finally, through whole-genome sequencing of propagated populations, we show that only POLQ-proficient animals accumulate genomic scars that are abundantly present in genomes of wild C. elegans, pointing towards POLQ as a major driver of genome diversification.",

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we described a novel natural allelic variant of human Pollambda (hPollambda) characterized by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), C/T variation in the first base of codon 438, resulting in the amino acid change Arg to Trp. In vitro enzyme activity assays of the purified W438 Pollambda variant revealed that it retained both DNA polymerization and deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) lyase activities, but had reduced base substitution fidelity. Ectopic expression of the W438 hPollambda variant in mammalian cells increases mutation frequency, affects the DSB repair NHEJ pathway, and generates chromosome aberrations. All these phenotypes are dependent upon the catalytic activity of the W438 hPollambda. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of a cancer-related natural variant of one specialized DNA polymerase can be associated to generic instability at the cromosomal level, probably due a defective NHEJ. These results establish that chromosomal aberrations can result from mutations in specialized DNA repair polymerases.",

A pull-down assay using deletion mutants of Pol lambda showed that the confined C-terminal region of Pol lambda directly binds to PCNA. Furthermore, a synthetic peptide of 20-mers derived from the C-terminal region of Pol lambda competes with full-length Pol lambda for binding to PCNA. The residues between amino acids 518 and 537 of Pol lambda are required for binding to PCNA, and are different from the consensus PCNA interacting motif (PIM). Pol lambda associates with PCNA in vivo by immunoprecipitation analysis and EGFP-tagged Pol lambda co-localizes with PCNA as spots within a nucleus using fluorescent microscopy. Through direct binding, PCNA suppressed the distributive nucleotidyltransferase activity of Pol lambda. Pol micro, which also belongs to the family X of DNA polymerases, binds to PCNA by a pivotal amino acid residue.",

We show here that immunoglobulin heavy chain junctions from pol lambda-deficient animals have shorter length with normal N-additions, thus indicating that pol lambda is recruited during heavy chain rearrangement at a step that precedes the action of TdT. In contrast to previous in vitro studies, analysis of animals with combined inactivation of these enzymes revealed no overlapping or compensatory activities for V(D)J recombination between pol mu, pol lambda, and TdT. This complex usage of polymerases with distinct catalytic specificities may correspond to the specific function that the third hypervariable region assumes for each immunoglobulin chain, with pol lambda maintaining a large heavy chain junctional heterogeneity and pol mu ensuring a restricted light chain junctional variability.",

abstract = "Maintenance of genome stability is carried out by a suite of DNA repair pathways that ensure the repair of damaged DNA and faithful replication of the genome. Of particular importance are the repair pathways, which respond to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and how the efficiency of repair is influenced by sequence homology. In this study, we developed a genetic assay in diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to analyze DSBs requiring microhomologies for repair, known as microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ). MMEJ repair efficiency increased concomitant with microhomology length and decreased upon introduction of mismatches. The central proteins in homologous recombination (HR), Rad52 and Rad51, suppressed MMEJ in this system, suggesting a competition between HR and MMEJ for the repair of a DSB. Importantly, we found that DNA polymerase delta (Pol $\delta$) is critical for MMEJ, independent of microhomology length and base-pairing continuity. MMEJ recombinants showed evidence that Pol $\delta$ proofreading function is active during MMEJ-mediated DSB repair. Furthermore, mutations in Pol $\delta$ and DNA polymerase 4 (Pol $\lambda$), the DNA polymerase previously implicated in MMEJ, cause a synergistic decrease in MMEJ repair. Pol $\lambda$ showed faster kinetics associating with MMEJ substrates following DSB induction than Pol $\delta$. The association of Pol $\delta$ depended on RAD1, which encodes the flap endonuclease needed to cleave MMEJ intermediates before DNA synthesis. Moreover, Pol $\delta$ recruitment was diminished in cells lacking Pol $\lambda$. These data suggest cooperative involvement of both polymerases in MMEJ.",

Here we show, that pollambda participates at the molecular level in a chromosomal context, in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSB) via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in mammalian cells. The expression of a catalytically inactive form of pollambda (pollambdaDN) decreases the frequency of NHEJ events in response to I-Sce-I-induced DSB whereas inactivated forms of its homologues polbeta and polmu do not. Only events requiring DNA end processing before ligation are affected; this defect is associated with large deletions arising in the vicinity of the induced DSB. Furthermore, pollambdaDN-expressing cells exhibit increased sensitization and genomic instability in response to ionizing radiation similar to that of NHEJ-defective cells. Our data support a requirement for pollambda in repairing a subset of DSB in genomic DNA, thereby contributing to the maintenance of genetic stability mediated by the NHEJ pathway.",

The inability of TdT to accommodate a template strand can be explained by steric hindrance at the catalytic site caused by a long lariat-like loop, which is absent in DNA polymerase beta. However, displacement of this discriminating loop would be sufficient to unmask a number of evolutionarily conserved residues, which could then interact with a template DNA strand. The present structure can be used to model the recently discovered human polymerase mu, with which it shares 43\% sequence identity.",

Template-independent TdT promotes diversity during NHEJ-dependent repair of V(D)J recombination intermediates, but the roles of the template-dependent polymerases mu and lambda in NHEJ remain unclear. We show here that pol mu and pol lambda are similarly recruited by NHEJ factors to fill gaps when ends have partially complementary overhangs, suggesting equivalent roles promoting accuracy in NHEJ. However, only pol mu promotes accuracy during immunoglobulin kappa recombination. This distinctive in vivo role correlates with the TdT-like ability of pol mu, but not pol lambda, to act when primer termini lack complementary bases in the template strand. However, unlike TdT, synthesis by pol mu in this context is primarily instructed by a template from another DNA molecule. This apparent gradient of template dependence is largely attributable to a small structural element that is present but different in all three polymerases.",

abstract = "Somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin variable genes, which increases antibody diversity, is initiated by the activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID) protein. The current DNA-deamination model posits that AID deaminates cytosine to uracil in DNA, and that mutations are generated by DNA polymerases during replication or repair of the uracil residue. Mutations could arise as follows: by DNA replicating past the uracil; by removing the uracil with a uracil glycosylase and replicating past the resulting abasic site with a low-fidelity polymerase; or by repairing the uracil and synthesizing a DNA-repair patch downstream using a low-fidelity polymerase. In this review, we summarize the biochemical properties of specialized DNA polymerases in mammalian cells and discuss their participation in the mechanisms of hypermutation. Many recent studies have examined mice deficient in the genes that encode various DNA polymerases, and have shown that DNA polymerase H (POLH) contributes to hypermutation, whereas POLI, POLK and several other enzymes do not have major roles. The low-fidelity enzyme POLQ has been proposed as another candidate polymerase because it can efficiently bypass abasic sites and recent evidence indicates that it might participate in hypermutation.",

The classification by Ito and Braithwaite (Ito and Braithwaite 1991) of the A, B, C, D, and X families has been extended to accommodate the ``Y family'' of DNA polymerases that are related to the eukaryotic RAD30 and the bacterial UmuC gene products. After analysis, our data suggest that no DNA polymerase family was universally conserved among the three biological domains and no simple evolutionary scenario could explain that observation. Furthermore, viruses and plasmids carry a remarkably diverse set of DNA polymerase genes, suggesting that lateral gene transfer is frequent and includes non-orthologous gene displacements between cells and viruses. The relationships between viral and host genes appear very complex. We propose that the gamma DNA polymerase of the mitochondrion replication apparatus is of phage origin and that this gene replaced the one in the bacterial ancestor. Often there was no obvious relation between the viral and the host DNA polymerase, but an interesting exception concerned the family B enzymes: in which ancient gene exchange can be detected between the viruses and their hosts. Additional evidence for horizontal gene transfers between cells and viruses comes from an analysis of the small damage-inducible DNA polymerases. Taken together, these findings suggest a complex evolutionary history of the DNA replication apparatus that involved significant exchanges between viruses, plasmids, and their hosts.",

Here, by combining a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of prokaryotic PolXs and biochemical experiments involving selected recombinant enzymes, we reveal a previously unrecognized group of PolXs that seem to be lacking DNA polymerase activity. The noncanonical PolXs contain substitutions of the key catalytic residues and deletions in their polymerase and dNTP binding sites in the palm and fingers domains, but contain functional nuclease domains, similar to canonical PolXs. We demonstrate that representative noncanonical PolXs from the Deinococcus genus are indeed inactive as DNA polymerases but are highly efficient as 3'-5' exonucleases. We show that both canonical and noncanonical PolXs are often encoded together with the components of the non-homologous end joining pathway and may therefore participate in double-strand break repair, suggesting an evolutionary conservation of this PolX function. This is a remarkable example of polymerases that have lost their main polymerase activity, but retain accessory functions in DNA processing and repair.",

abstract = "Transposable elements have clearly played a major role in shaping both the size and organization of eukaryotic genomes. However, the evolution of essential genes in core biological processes may also have been shaped by coevolution with these elements. This would be predicted to occur in instances where host proteins are either hijacked for use by mobile elements or recruited to defend against them. To detect such cases, we have used the Saccharomyces cerevisiae-Saccharomyces paradoxus sibling species pair to identify genes that have evolved under positive selection. We identify 72 such genes, which participate in a variety of biological processes but are enriched for genes involved in meiosis and DNA repair by nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). We confirm the signature of positive selection acting on NHEJ genes using orthologous sequences from all seven Saccharomyces sensu stricto species. Previous studies have found altered rates of Ty retrotransposition when these NHEJ genes are disrupted. We propose that the evolution of these repair proteins is likely to have been shaped by their interactions with Ty elements. Antagonistic pleiotropy, where critical genes like those involved in DNA repair are also subject to selective pressures imposed by mobile elements, could favor alleles that might be otherwise deleterious for their normal roles related to genome stability.",

abstract = "Inteins are intervening protein sequences that undergo self-excision from a precursor protein with concomitant joining of the flanking sequences. Here, we demonstrate intein trans-splicing in Nicotiana tabacum chloroplasts by using the naturally split Ssp DnaE intein. Trans-splicing occurred whether both intein fragments were encoded in the chloroplast or were separated into the chloroplast and nuclear genomes. A biolistic approach was used to integrate two fusion genes, one encoding aminoglycoside-3-adenyltransferase (aadA) and the first 123 aa of the Ssp DnaE intein (In) and the other encoding 36 C-terminal amino acid residues of the Ssp DnaE intein (Ic) and soluble modified green fluorescent protein (smGFP) into N. tabacum plastids. Expression of these gene fragments in the chloroplast resulted in ligated aadA-smGFP due to In-Ic-mediated trans-splicing. Furthermore, an N-terminal portion of the herbicide resistance gene 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) containing a chloroplast localization signal fused to In (EPSPSn-In) was integrated into the nuclear DNA of N. tabacum by using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. The remaining EPSPS gene fragment (EPSPSc) fused to Ic (Ic-EPSPSc) was integrated into the chloroplast genome by homologous recombination. Western blot analysis of cell extracts from these plants showed a full-length EPSPS, demonstrating that the EPSPSn-In gene product migrated to the chloroplast and underwent trans-splicing. Furthermore, these transgenic plants displayed improved resistance to the herbicide N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine (glyphosate) when compared with wild-type N. tabacum.",

abstract = "CRISPR-Cas systems are widespread adaptive antiviral systems used in prokaryotes. Some phages, in turn, although have small genomes can economize the use of genetic space to encode compact or incomplete CRISPR-Cas systems to inhibit the host and establish infection. Phage ICP1, infecting Vibrio cholerae, encodes a compact type I-F CRISPR-Cas system to suppress the antiphage mobile genetic element in the host genome. However, the mechanism by which this compact system recognizes the target DNA and executes interference remains elusive. Here, we present the electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of both apo- and DNA-bound ICP1 surveillance complexes (Aka Csy complex). Unlike most other type I surveillance complexes, the ICP1 Csy complex lacks the Cas11 subunit or a structurally homologous domain, which is crucial for dsDNA binding and Cas3 activation in other type I CRISPR-Cas systems. Structural and functional analyses revealed that the compact ICP1 Csy complex alone is inefficient in binding to dsDNA targets, presumably stalled at a partial R-loop conformation. The presence of Cas2/3 facilitates dsDNA binding and allows effective dsDNA target cleavage. Additionally, we found that Pseudomonas aeruginosa Cas2/3 efficiently cleaved the dsDNA target presented by the ICP1 Csy complex, but not vice versa. These findings suggest a unique mechanism for target dsDNA binding and cleavage by the compact phage-derived CRISPR-Cas system.",

However, many single-nucleotide mutations cannot be discriminated from wild-type alleles by current CRISPR-Cas systems.

Cas12j-8 is a highly specific nuclease sensitive to single-nucleotide mismatches in the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-proximal region. We experimentally proved that Cas12j-8 enabled allele-specific disruption of genes with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Cas12j-8 recognizes a simple TTN PAM that provides for high target site density. In silico analysis reveals that Cas12j-8 enables allele-specific disruption of 25,931 clinically relevant variants in the ClinVar database, and 485,130,147 SNPs in the dbSNP database. Therefore, Cas12j-8 would be particularly suitable for therapeutic applications.",

abstract = "Mutation is the source of genetic variation and fuels biological evolution. Many mutations first arise as DNA replication errors. These errors subsequently evade correction by cellular DNA repair, for example, by the well-known DNA mismatch repair (MMR) mechanism. Here, we determine the genome-wide effects of MMR on mutation. We first identify almost 9000 mutations accumulated over five generations in eight MMR-deficient mutation accumulation (MA) lines of the model plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana We then show that MMR deficiency greatly increases the frequency of both smaller-scale insertions and deletions (indels) and of single-nucleotide variant (SNV) mutations. Most indels involve A or T nucleotides and occur preferentially in homopolymeric (poly A or poly T) genomic stretches. In addition, we find that the likelihood of occurrence of indels in homopolymeric stretches is strongly related to stretch length, and that this relationship causes ultrahigh localized mutation rates in specific homopolymeric stretch regions. For SNVs, we show that MMR deficiency both increases their frequency and changes their molecular mutational spectrum, causing further enhancement of the GC to AT bias characteristic of organisms with normal MMR function. Our final genome-wide analyses show that MMR deficiency disproportionately increases the numbers of SNVs in genes, rather than in nongenic regions of the genome. This latter observation indicates that MMR preferentially protects genes from mutation and has important consequences for understanding the evolution of genomes during both natural selection and human tumor growth.",

In vertebrates, these breaks are predominantly repaired by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), which pairs DNA ends in a multiprotein synaptic complex to promote their direct ligation. NHEJ is a highly versatile pathway that uses an array of processing enzymes to modify damaged DNA ends and enable their ligation. The mechanisms of end synapsis and end processing have important implications for genome stability. Rapid and stable synapsis is necessary to limit chromosome translocations that result from the mispairing of DNA ends. Furthermore, end processing must be tightly regulated to minimize mutations at the break site.

abstract = "CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has revolutionized functional genomics in vertebrates. However, CRISPR/Cas9 edited F0 animals too often demonstrate variable phenotypic penetrance due to the mosaic nature of editing outcomes after double strand break (DSB) repair. Even with high efficiency levels of genome editing, phenotypes may be obscured by proportional presence of in-frame mutations that still produce functional protein. Recently, studies in cell culture systems have shown that the nature of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutations can be dependent on local sequence context and can be predicted by computational methods. Here, we demonstrate that similar approaches can be used to forecast CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing outcomes in Xenopus tropicalis, Xenopus laevis, and zebrafish. We show that a publicly available neural network previously trained in mouse embryonic stem cell cultures (InDelphi-mESC) is able to accurately predict CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing outcomes in early vertebrate embryos. Our observations can have direct implications for experiment design, allowing the selection of guide RNAs with predicted repair outcome signatures enriched towards frameshift mutations, allowing maximization of CRISPR/Cas9 phenotype penetrance in the F0 generation.",

These rapidly developing techniques are likely to revolutionize the breeding of new crop varieties. Since genome editing can lead to the development of plants that could also have come into existence naturally or by conventional breeding techniques, there are strong arguments that these cases should not be classified as genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and be regulated no differently from conventionally bred crops. If a specific regulation would be regarded necessary, the application of genome editing for crop development may challenge risk assessment and post-market monitoring. In the session ``Plant genome editing-any novel features to consider for ERA and regulation?'' held at the 14th ISBGMO, scientists from various disciplines as well as regulators, risk assessors and potential users of the new technologies were brought together for a knowledge-based discussion to identify knowledge gaps and analyze scenarios for the introduction of genome-edited crops into the environment.

Genome-editing technologies have led to a new era of genome engineering, enabling an effective, precise, and rapid engineering of the plant genomes. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) has emerged as a new genome-editing tool, extensively applied in various organisms, including plants. The use of CRISPR/Cas9 allows generating transgene-free genome-edited plants (``null segregants'') in a short period of time. In this review, we provide a critical overview of the recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9 derived technologies for inducing mutations at target sites in the genome and controlling the expression of target genes. We highlight the major breakthroughs in applying CRISPR/Cas9 to plant engineering, and challenges toward the production of null segregants. We also provide an update on the efforts of engineering Cas9 proteins, newly discovered Cas9 variants, and novel CRISPR/Cas systems for use in plants. The application of CRISPR/Cas9 and related technologies in plant engineering will not only facilitate molecular breeding of crop plants but also accelerate progress in basic research.",

abstract = "The optimization of plant architecture in order to breed high-yielding soya bean cultivars is a goal of researchers. Tall plants bearing many long branches are desired, but only modest success in reaching these goals has been achieved. MicroRNA156 (miR156)-SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) gene modules play pivotal roles in controlling shoot architecture and other traits in crops like rice and wheat. However, the effects of miR156-SPL modules on soya bean architecture and yield, and the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects, remain largely unknown. In this study, we achieved substantial improvements in soya bean architecture and yield by overexpressing GmmiR156b. Transgenic plants produced significantly increased numbers of long branches, nodes and pods, and they exhibited an increased 100-seed weight, resulting in a 46\%-63\% increase in yield per plant. Intriguingly, GmmiR156b overexpression had no significant impact on plant height in a growth room or under field conditions; however, it increased stem thickness significantly. Our data indicate that GmmiR156b modulates these traits mainly via the direct cleavage of SPL transcripts. Moreover, we found that GmSPL9d is expressed in the shoot apical meristem and axillary meristems (AMs) of soya bean, and that GmSPL9d may regulate axillary bud formation and branching by physically interacting with the homeobox gene WUSCHEL (WUS), a central regulator of AM formation. Together, our results identify GmmiR156b as a promising target for the improvement of soya bean plant architecture and yields, and they reveal a new and conserved regulatory cascade involving miR156-SPL-WUS that will help researchers decipher the genetic basis of plant architecture.",

We found that TONSOKU (TSK/TONSL), which rescues broken replication forks, specifically interacts with H3.1 via recognition of alanine 31 by its tetratricopeptide repeat domain. Our results indicate that genomic instability in the absence of ATXR5/ATXR6-catalyzed histone H3 lysine 27 monomethylation in plants depends on H3.1, TSK, and DNA polymerase theta (Pol $\vartheta$).

abstract = "Genome editing occurs in the context of chromatin, which is heterogeneous in structure and function across the genome. Chromatin heterogeneity is thought to affect genome editing efficiency, but this has been challenging to quantify due to the presence of confounding variables. Here, we develop a method that exploits the allele-specific chromatin status of imprinted genes in order to address this problem in cycling mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Because maternal and paternal alleles of imprinted genes have identical DNA sequence and are situated in the same nucleus, allele-specific differences in the frequency and spectrum of mutations induced by CRISPR-Cas9 can be unequivocally attributed to epigenetic mechanisms. We found that heterochromatin can impede mutagenesis, but to a degree that depends on other key experimental parameters. Mutagenesis was impeded by up to 7-fold when Cas9 exposure was brief and when intracellular Cas9 expression was low. In contrast, the outcome of mutagenic DNA repair was unaffected by chromatin state, with similar efficiencies of homology-directed repair (HDR) and deletion spectra on maternal and paternal chromosomes. Combined, our data show that heterochromatin imposes a permeable barrier that influences the kinetics, but not the endpoint, of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and suggest that therapeutic applications involving low-level Cas9 exposure will be particularly affected by chromatin status.",

However, cold temperature stimulates the accumulation of reducing sugars in potato tubers. Upon high-temperature processing, these reducing sugars react with free amino acids, resulting in brown, bitter-tasting products and elevated levels of acrylamide--a potential carcinogen. To minimize the accumulation of reducing sugars, RNA interference (RNAi) technology was used to silence the vacuolar invertase gene (VInv), which encodes a protein that breaks down sucrose to glucose and fructose. Because RNAi often results in incomplete gene silencing and requires the plant to be transgenic, here we used transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to knockout VInv within the commercial potato variety, Ranger Russet. We isolated 18 plants containing mutations in at least one VInv allele, and five of these plants had mutations in all VInv alleles. Tubers from full VInv-knockout plants had undetectable levels of reducing sugars, and processed chips contained reduced levels of acrylamide and were lightly coloured. Furthermore, seven of the 18 modified plant lines appeared to contain no TALEN DNA insertions in the potato genome. These results provide a framework for using TALENs to quickly improve traits in commercially relevant autotetraploid potato lines.",

abstract = "Genetic engineering is a molecular biology technique that enables a gene or genes to be inserted into a plant's genome. The first genetically engineered plants were grown commercially in 1996, and the most common genetically engineered traits are herbicide and insect resistance. Questions and concerns have been raised about the effects of these traits on the environment and human health, many of which are addressed in a pair of 2008 and 2009 Annual Review of Plant Biology articles. As new science is published and new techniques like genome editing emerge, reanalysis of some of these issues, and a look at emerging issues, is warranted. Herein, an analysis of relevant scientific literature is used to present a scientific perspective on selected topics related to genetic engineering and genome editing.

abstract = "The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a prevalent and versatile genome-editing tool of choice for basic and applied biological research. An exchange of a 20-bp spacer sequence in the gRNA can easily reprogram Cas9 to target a different DNA site. By expressing or providing multiple gRNAs, the system also enables multiplex genome editing at high efficiencies. Current approaches for providing multiple gRNAs in vivo include the use of multigene cassettes to express several gRNAs, Csy4-based excision, arrays of crRNAs, ribozyme-flanked gRNAs, tRNA-dependent cleavage of gRNAs, and direct introduction of Cas9 proteins preloaded with different gRNAs. By simultaneously targeting multiple DNA sequences, multiplex genome editing can be used to knockout multiple genes or delete chromosomal fragments. Off-target risk can also be reduced by Cas9-dimers that require the simultaneous expression of two gRNAs. With multiple gRNAs, specific gene expression or methylation status can be efficiently controlled by dCas9 fused to activators, repressors, methyltransferase, demethylase, or other functional domains. As a result, multiplex genome editing is expected to accelerate functional discovery of plant genes as well as genetic improvement of agricultural crops.",

However, plant breeding is currently limited by incremental improvements in quantitative traits that often rely on laborious selection of rare naturally occurring mutations in gene-regulatory regions. Here, we demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of promoters generates diverse cis-regulatory alleles that provide beneficial quantitative variation for breeding. We devised a simple genetic scheme, which exploits trans-generational heritability of Cas9 activity in heterozygous loss-of-function mutant backgrounds, to rapidly evaluate the phenotypic impact of numerous promoter variants for genes regulating three major productivity traits in tomato: fruit size, inflorescence branching, and plant architecture. Our approach allows immediate selection and fixation of novel alleles in transgene-free plants and fine manipulation of yield components. Beyond a platform to enhance variation for diverse agricultural traits, our findings provide a foundation for dissecting complex relationships between gene-regulatory changes and control of quantitative traits.",

Availability of transformation methods markedly expand the application of a model. We chose to develop an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer method for Setaria viridis A10.1. Regenerable callus was recovered from mature seeds without seed coats that were disinfected and cultured on a Murashige and Skoog-based medium supplemented with 40 g/L maltose, 2 mg/L 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 0.5 mg/L kinetin, and 4 g/L Gelzan. The gelling agents Gelzan and Phytagel were found to be critical for recovery of a high quality callus as compared to agar that resulted in a gelatinous, brown, non-regenerable callus. For transformation, the callus was infected with the A. tumefaciens strain AGL1 that contained binary vectors with the hygromycin phosphotransferase selectable marker gene, which confers resistance to the antibiotic hygromycin. The transformation efficiency, which is defined as the percent of infected callus that gives rise to at least one independent transgenic line ranged from 0.3 to 15 \% depending upon the vector backbone used to design constructs and the gene of interest that was either overexpressed or had a knockdown of expression. Transgenic lines were first verified by PCR, then positive plants were moved forward for copy number determination by either Southern or TaqMan\textregistered{} analysis. On average, 42 \% of the transgenic lines contained one copy of the introduced transgene. Availability of a transformation methodology has contributed to the adoption of S. viridis as a model species by researchers worldwide.",

Here we describe dimeric RNA-guided FokI nucleases (RFNs) that can recognize extended sequences and edit endogenous genes with high efficiencies in human cells. RFN cleavage activity depends strictly on the binding of two guide RNAs (gRNAs) to DNA with a defined spacing and orientation substantially reducing the likelihood that a suitable target site will occur more than once in the genome and therefore improving specificities relative to wild-type Cas9 monomers. RFNs guided by a single gRNA generally induce lower levels of unwanted mutations than matched monomeric Cas9 nickases. In addition, we describe a simple method for expressing multiple gRNAs bearing any 5' end nucleotide, which gives dimeric RFNs a broad targeting range. RFNs combine the ease of RNA-based targeting with the specificity enhancement inherent to dimerization and are likely to be useful in applications that require highly precise genome editing.",

abstract = "Maize is one of the most important crops in the world. However, few agronomically important maize genes have been cloned and used for trait improvement, due to the complex genome and genetic architecture. Here we integrated multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9-based high-throughput targeted mutagenesis with genetic mapping and genomic approaches to successfully knock-out 743 candidate genes corresponding to agronomic and nutritional traits. After low-cost barcode-based deep sequencing, 412 edited sequences covering 118 genes were precisely identified from individuals showing clear phenotypic changes. This mutant profile was similar to the ones identified in human cell lines and predictable. An unexpectedly frequent homology-directed repair through endogenous templates was observed and likely caused by the spatial contact between distinct chromosomes. Through several case studies on validation and interpretation of gene function, this targeted mutagenesis library suggested that the integration of forward- and reverse- genetics promises rapid validation of important agronomic genes for crops with complex genomes. Beyond specific findings, this study also guides further optimization of high-throughput CRISPR experiments in plants.",

abstract = "Current genome-editing technologies introduce double-stranded (ds) DNA breaks at a target locus as the first step to gene correction. Although most genetic diseases arise from point mutations, current approaches to point mutation correction are inefficient and typically induce an abundance of random insertions and deletions (indels) at the target locus resulting from the cellular response to dsDNA breaks. Here we report the development of 'base editing', a new approach to genome editing that enables the direct, irreversible conversion of one target DNA base into another in a programmable manner, without requiring dsDNA backbone cleavage or a donor template. We engineered fusions of CRISPR/Cas9 and a cytidine deaminase enzyme that retain the ability to be programmed with a guide RNA, do not induce dsDNA breaks, and mediate the direct conversion of cytidine to uridine, thereby effecting a C$\rightarrow$T (or G$\rightarrow$A) substitution. The resulting 'base editors' convert cytidines within a window of approximately five nucleotides, and can efficiently correct a variety of point mutations relevant to human disease. In four transformed human and murine cell lines, second- and third-generation base editors that fuse uracil glycosylase inhibitor, and that use a Cas9 nickase targeting the non-edited strand, manipulate the cellular DNA repair response to favour desired base-editing outcomes, resulting in permanent correction of ~15-75\% of total cellular DNA with minimal (typically $\leq$1\%) indel formation. Base editing expands the scope and efficiency of genome editing of point mutations.",

abstract = "The spontaneous deamination of cytosine is a major source of transitions from C•G to T•A base pairs, which account for half of known pathogenic point mutations in humans. The ability to efficiently convert targeted A•T base pairs to G•C could therefore advance the study and treatment of genetic diseases. The deamination of adenine yields inosine, which is treated as guanine by polymerases, but no enzymes are known to deaminate adenine in DNA. Here we describe adenine base editors (ABEs) that mediate the conversion of A•T to G•C in genomic DNA. We evolved a transfer RNA adenosine deaminase to operate on DNA when fused to a catalytically impaired CRISPR-Cas9 mutant. Extensive directed evolution and protein engineering resulted in seventh-generation ABEs that convert targeted A•T base pairs efficiently to G•C (approximately 50\% efficiency in human cells) with high product purity (typically at least 99.9\%) and low rates of indels (typically no more than 0.1\%). ABEs introduce point mutations more efficiently and cleanly, and with less off-target genome modification, than a current Cas9 nuclease-based method, and can install disease-correcting or disease-suppressing mutations in human cells. Together with previous base editors, ABEs enable the direct, programmable introduction of all four transition mutations without double-stranded DNA cleavage.",

abstract = "While the catalog of mammalian transcripts and their expression levels in different cell types and disease states is rapidly expanding, our understanding of transcript function lags behind. We present a robust technology enabling systematic investigation of the cellular consequences of repressing or inducing individual transcripts. We identify rules for specific targeting of transcriptional repressors (CRISPRi), typically achieving 90\%-99\% knockdown with minimal off-target effects, and activators (CRISPRa) to endogenous genes via endonuclease-deficient Cas9. Together they enable modulation of gene expression over a ∼1,000-fold range. Using these rules, we construct genome-scale CRISPRi and CRISPRa libraries, each of which we validate with two pooled screens. Growth-based screens identify essential genes, tumor suppressors, and regulators of differentiation. Screens for sensitivity to a cholera-diphtheria toxin provide broad insights into the mechanisms of pathogen entry, retrotranslocation and toxicity. Our results establish CRISPRi and CRISPRa as powerful tools that provide rich and complementary information for mapping complex pathways.",

Potential future crops derived through genome engineering include those that better withstand pests, that have enhanced nutritional value, and that are able to grow on marginal lands. In many instances, crops with such traits will be created by altering only a few nucleotides among the billions that comprise plant genomes. As such, and with the appropriate regulatory structures in place, crops created through genome engineering might prove to be more acceptable to the public than plants that carry foreign DNA in their genomes.

Gibberellin (GA) levels and soybean GA20ox2 and CYP707A2 transcripts of high-efficiency genotypes increased and were higher than those of low-efficiency genotypes; however, the opposite performance was shown in abscisic acid (ABA). Higher zeatin riboside (ZR) content and DNA quantity, and relatively higher expression of soybean IPT5, CYCD3 and CYCA3 were obtained in high-efficiency genotypes. High-efficiency genotypes had low methyl jasmonate (MeJA) content, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) activity, and relatively lower expression of soybean OPR3, PPO1 and PRX71. GA and ZR were positive plant factors for Agrobacterium-mediated soybean transformation by facilitating germination and growth, and increasing the number of cells in DNA synthesis cycle, respectively; MeJA, PPO, POD and ABA were negative plant factors by inducing defence reactions and repressing germination and growth, respectively.",

abstract = "Soybean oil is high in polyunsaturated fats and is often partially hydrogenated to increase its shelf life and improve oxidative stability. The trans-fatty acids produced through hydrogenation pose a health threat. Soybean lines that are low in polyunsaturated fats were generated by introducing mutations in two fatty acid desaturase 2 genes (FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B), which in the seed convert the monounsaturated fat, oleic acid, to the polyunsaturated fat, linoleic acid. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) were engineered to recognize and cleave conserved DNA sequences in both genes. In four of 19 transgenic soybean lines expressing the TALENs, mutations in FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B were observed in DNA extracted from leaf tissue; three of the four lines transmitted heritable FAD2-1 mutations to the next generation. The fatty acid profile of the seed was dramatically changed in plants homozygous for mutations in both FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B: oleic acid increased from 20\% to 80\% and linoleic acid decreased from 50\% to under 4\%. Further, mutant plants were identified that lacked the TALEN transgene and only carried the targeted mutations. The ability to create a valuable trait in a single generation through targeted modification of a gene family demonstrates the power of TALENs for genome engineering and crop improvement.",

Explants were bombarded with recombinant plasmids engineered for the expression of cryIAc transgene in plants and stable transformants regenerated in presence of benzyladenine, kinetin and kanamycin. Transformation frequency showed dependence on explant type, cultivars, plasmids, helium pressure and microcarrier type used. Integration of transgenes was demonstrated using polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot hybridization approaches in T (0) plants. The expression of CryIA(c) delta-endotoxin and GUS enzyme was ascertained by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and histochemical assays, respectively. These transgenic plants (T (0)) showed more protection and high mortality for Heliothis armigera and Spodoptera litura larvae as compared to control plants. The results of the present study indicate that highest transformation frequency (18\%) could be achieved by use of gold as a microcarrier in combination with helium pressure of 900 psi. Among the other factors tested, plasmid pHS 102 was the most efficient plasmid, while epicotyl explant was the best explant source for particle gun bombardment.

Efficient genetic transformation in plants remains a challenge due to the cell wall, a barrier to exogenous biomolecule delivery. Conventional delivery methods are inefficient, damaging to tissue, or are only effective in a limited number of plant species. Nanoparticles are promising materials for biomolecule delivery, owing to their ability to traverse plant cell walls without external force and highly tunable physicochemical properties for diverse cargo conjugation and broad host range applicability. With the advent of engineered nuclease biotechnologies, we discuss the potential of nanoparticles as an optimal platform to deliver biomolecules to plants for genetic engineering.",

abstract = "Constitutive expression of the Zea mays L. (maize) morphogenic transcription factors Baby Boom (Bbm) and Wuschel2 (Wus2) in maize can not only greatly increase transformation efficiency but can also induce phenotypic abnormalities and sterility. In an effort to alleviate the pleiotropic effects of constitutive expression, a genome wide search was undertaken to find suitable maize promoters to drive tissue and timing-specific expression of the transformation enhancing genes Bbm and Wus2. A promoter from a maize phospholipid transferase protein gene (Zm-PLTPpro) was identified based on its expression in leaves, embryos, and callus while being downregulated in roots, meristems, and reproductive tissues. When Zm-PLTPprodriving Bbm was transformed into immature maize embryos along with a Wus2 expression cassette driven by the nopaline synthase promoter (Nospro::Wus2) abundant somatic embryos rapidly formed on the scutella. These embryos were individual and uniformly transformed and could be directly germinated into plants without a callus phase. Transformed plants could be sent to the greenhouse in as little as 1 mo and regenerated plants matched the seed-derived phenotype for the inbred and were fertile. However, T1 seed from these plants had poor germination. Replacing Nosprowith a maize auxin-inducible promoter (Zm-Axig1pro) in combination with Zm-PLTPpro::Bbm, allowed healthy, fertile plants to be regenerated. Single-copy T1 seed germinated normally and had a predominantly wild-type inbred phenotype. For maize, this callus-free transformation process has worked in all inbred lines tested.",

abstract = "An important advantage of delivering CRISPR reagents into cells as a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex is the ability to edit genes without reagents being integrated into the genome. Transient presence of RNP molecules in cells can reduce undesirable off-target effects. One method for RNP delivery into plant cells is the use of a biolistic gun. To facilitate selection of transformed cells during RNP delivery, a plasmid carrying a selectable marker gene can be co-delivered with the RNP to enrich for transformed/edited cells. In this work, we compare targeted mutagenesis in rice using three different delivery platforms: biolistic RNP/DNA co-delivery; biolistic DNA delivery; and Agrobacterium-mediated delivery. All three platforms were successful in generating desired mutations at the target sites. However, we observed a high frequency (over 14\%) of random plasmid or chromosomal DNA fragment insertion at the target sites in transgenic events generated from both biolistic delivery platforms. In contrast, integration of random DNA fragments was not observed in transgenic events generated from the Agrobacterium-mediated method. These data reveal important insights that must be considered when selecting the method for genome-editing reagent delivery in plants, and emphasize the importance of employing appropriate molecular screening methods to detect unintended alterations following genome engineering.",

abstract = "KEY MESSAGE: Discriminatory co-expression of maize BBM and WUS transcriptional factor genes promoted somatic embryogenesis and efficient Agrobacterium -mediated transformation of recalcitrant maize inbred B73 and sorghum P898012 genotypes without use of a selectable marker gene. The use of morphogenic regulators to overcome barriers in plant transformation is a revolutionary breakthrough for basic plant science and crop applications. Current standard plant transformation systems are bottlenecks for genetic, genomic, and crop improvement studies. We investigated the differential use of co-expression of maize transcription factors BABY BOOM and WUSCHEL2 coupled with a desiccation inducible CRE/lox excision system to enable regeneration of stable transgenic recalcitrant maize inbred B73 and sorghum P898012 without a chemical selectable marker. The PHP78891 expression cassette contains CRE driven by the drought inducible maize RAB17M promoter with lox P sites which bracket the CRE, WUS, and BBM genes. A constitutive maize UBI M promoter directs a ZsGreen GFP expression cassette as a reporter outside of the excision sites and provides transient, transgenic, and developmental analysis. This was coupled with evidence for molecular integration and analysis of stable integration and desiccation inducible CRE-mediated excision. Agrobacterium-mediated transgenic introduction of this vector showed transient expression of GFP and induced somatic embryogenesis in maize B73 and sorghum P898012 explants. Subjection to desiccation stress in tissue culture enabled the excision of CRE, WUS, and BBM, leaving the UBI M::GFP cassette and allowing subsequent plant regeneration and GFP expression analysis. Stable GFP expression was observed in the early and late somatic embryos, young shoots, vegetative plant organs, and pollen. Transgene integration and expression of GFP positive T0 plants were also analyzed using PCR and Southern blots. Progeny segregation analysis of primary events confirmed correlation between functional GFP expression and presence of the GFP transgene in T1 plants generated from self pollinations, indicating good transgene inheritance. This study confirms and extends the use of morphogenic regulators to overcome transformation barriers.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Soybean is subjected to genetic manipulation by breeding, mutation, and transgenic approaches to produce value-added quality traits. Among those genetic approaches, mutagenesis through fast neutrons radiation is intriguing because it yields a variety of mutations, including single/multiple gene deletions and/or duplications. Characterizing the seed composition of the fast neutron mutants and its relationship with gene mutation is useful towards understanding oil and protein traits in soybean. RESULTS: From a large population of fast neutron mutagenized plants, we selected ten mutants based on a screening of total oil and protein content using near infra-red spectroscopy. These ten mutants were regrown, and the seeds were analyzed for oil by GC-MS, protein profiling by SDS-PAGE and gene mapping by comparative genomic hybridization. The mutant 2R29C14Cladecr233cMN15 (nicknamed in this study as L10) showed higher protein and lower oil content compared to the wild type, followed by three other lines (nicknamed in this study as L03, L05, and L06). We characterized the fatty acid methyl esters profile of the trans-esterified oil and found the presence of five major fatty acids (palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids) at varying proportions among the mutants. Protein profile using SDS-PAGE of the ten mutants did exhibit discernable variation between storage (glycinin and $\beta$-conglycinin) and anti-nutritional factor (trypsin inhibitor) proteins. In addition, we physically mapped the position of the gene deletions or duplications in each mutant using comparative genomic hybridization. CONCLUSION: Characterization of oil and protein profile in soybean fast neutron mutants will assist scientist and breeders to develop new value-added soybeans with improved protein and oil quality traits.",

Here we describe a set of tools for Cas9-mediated genome editing via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) in mammalian cells, as well as generation of modified cell lines for downstream functional studies. To minimize off-target cleavage, we further describe a double-nicking strategy using the Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs. This protocol provides experimentally derived guidelines for the selection of target sites, evaluation of cleavage efficiency and analysis of off-target activity. Beginning with target design, gene modifications can be achieved within as little as 1-2 weeks, and modified clonal cell lines can be derived within 2-3 weeks.",

abstract = "DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair is mediated by multiple pathways. It is thought that the local chromatin context affects the pathway choice, but the underlying principles are poorly understood. Using a multiplexed reporter assay in combination with Cas9 cutting, we systematically measure the relative activities of three DSB repair pathways as a function of chromatin context in >1,000 genomic locations. This reveals that non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is broadly biased toward euchromatin, while the contribution of microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) is higher in specific heterochromatin contexts. In H3K27me3-marked heterochromatin, inhibition of the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 reverts the balance toward NHEJ. Single-stranded template repair (SSTR), often used for precise CRISPR editing, competes with MMEJ and is moderately linked to chromatin context. These results provide insight into the impact of chromatin on DSB repair pathway balance and guidance for the design of Cas9-mediated genome editing experiments.",

However both have DNA polymerase activity in vitro and share similar structural organization, including a BRCT domain, helix-loop-helix DNA-binding motifs and polymerase X domain. mRNA expression of pol lambda is highest in testis and fetal liver, while expression of pol mu is more lymphoid, with highest expression both in thymus and tonsillar B cells. An unusually large number of splice variants is observed for the pol mu gene, most of which affect the polymerase domain. Expression of mRNA of both polymerases is down-regulated upon treatment by DNA damaging agents (UV light, gamma-rays or H(2)O(2)).

Polymerase chain reaction-based screening with degenerate primers targeted to the BRCT motif resulted in the isolation of a human cDNA for a previously unidentified DNA polymerase (designated DNA polymerase beta2) that is closely related to DNA polymerase beta (Pol beta). The predicted Pol beta2 protein contains a BRCT motif in its NH(2)-terminal region; its COOH-terminal region exhibits 33\% sequence identity to a corresponding region of human Pol beta. The Pol beta2 gene is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with transcripts being most abundant in testis. A fusion construct comprising Pol beta2 and green fluorescent protein exhibited a predominantly nuclear localization in transfected HeLa cells. Recombinant human Pol beta2 from insect cells exhibited substantial DNA polymerase activity, but it did not possess terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase activity. A truncated Pol beta2 mutant lacking the BRCT motif retained substantial DNA polymerase activity, whereas a mutant Pol beta2 with two alanine point mutations within the DNA polymerase active site did not. These results indicate that Pol beta2 is a Pol beta-related DNA polymerase with a BRCT motif that is dispensable for its polymerase activity.",

Our analysis demonstrated that pol lambda Phe506Arg/Gly mutants possess very low polymerase and terminal transferase activities as well as greatly reduced abilities for processive DNA synthesis and for carrying on translesion synthesis past an abasic site. The Tyr505Ala mutant, on the other hand, showed an altered nucleotide binding selectivity to perform the terminal transferase activity.

Two hormone systems that universally control flowering and plant architecture, florigen and gibberellin, were the source of multiple revolutions that modified reproductive transitions and proportional growth among plant parts. Although step changes based on serendipitous mutations in these hormone systems laid the foundation, genetic and agronomic tuning were required for broad agricultural benefits. We propose that generating targeted genetic variation in core components of both systems would elicit a wider range of phenotypic variation. Incorporating this enhanced diversity into breeding programs of conventional and underutilized crops could help to meet the future needs of the human diet and promote sustainable agriculture.",

However, it is challenging to profile Cas9 activity in the endogenous cellular environment. Here we leverage our TRIP technology to integrate ~ 1k barcoded reporter genes in the genomes of mouse embryonic stem cells. We target the integrated reporters (IRs) using RNA-guided Cas9 and characterize induced mutations by sequencing. We report that gRNA-sequence and IR locus explain most variation in mutation efficiency. Predominant insertions of a gRNA-specific nucleotide are consistent with template-dependent repair of staggered DNA ends with 1-bp 5' overhangs. We confirm that such staggered ends are induced by Cas9 in mouse pre-B cells. To explain observed insertions, we propose a model generating primarily blunt and occasionally staggered DNA ends. Mutation patterns indicate that gRNA-sequence controls the fraction of staggered ends, which could be used to optimize Cas9-based insertion efficiency.",

abstract = "Three of the four family X polymerases, DNA polymerase lambda, DNA polymerase mu, and TdT, have been associated with repair of double-strand DNA breaks by nonhomologous end-joining. Their involvement in this DNA repair process requires an N-terminal BRCT domain that mediates interaction with other protein factors required for recognition and binding of broken DNA ends. Here we present the NMR solution structure of the BRCT domain of DNA polymerase lambda, completing the structural portrait for this family of enzymes. Analysis of the overall fold of the polymerase lambda BRCT domain reveals structural similarity to the BRCT domains of polymerase mu and TdT, yet highlights some key sequence and structural differences that may account for important differences in the biological activities of these enzymes and their roles in nonhomologous end-joining. Mutagenesis studies indicate that the conserved Arg57 residue of Pol lambda plays a more critical role for binding to the XRCC4-Ligase IV complex than its structural homolog in Pol mu, Arg43. In contrast, the hydrophobic Leu60 residue of Pol lambda contributes less significantly to binding than the structurally homologous Phe46 residue of Pol mu. A third leucine residue involved in the binding and activity of Pol mu, is nonconservatively replaced by a glutamine in Pol lambda (Gln64) and, based on binding and activity data, is apparently unimportant for Pol lambda interactions with the NHEJ complex. In conclusion, both the structure of the Pol lambda BRCT domain and its mode of interaction with the other components of the NHEJ complex significantly differ from the two previously studied homologs, Pol mu and TdT.",

The survey consolidates a body of literature that suggests that the type (insertion, deletion, and complex) and the approximate length of indel edits can be somewhat customized with different GEENs and by manipulating the expression of key NHEJ genes. Structural data suggest that binding of GEENs to DNA may interfere with binding of key components of DNA repair complexes, favoring either classical- or alternative-NHEJ. The hypotheses have some limitations, but if validated, will enable scientists to better control indel makeup, holding promise for basic science and clinical applications of gene editing.

abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Members of the family Geminiviridae have been reported to infect either a monocot plant or a dicot plant, but not both. This study reports a geminivirus, Wheat Dwarf India Virus (WDIV), first identified in wheat, that is capable of infecting both monocot and dicot plants and acting as a viral vector. OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed at developing a broad host range viral vector system for reverse genetics and genome editing. METHODS: Here we used a wheat isolate of WDIV and Ageratum yellow leaf curl betasatellite (AYLCB) for infectivity assays and vector development. We performed Agrobacterium-mediated inoculation of WDIV and AYLCB in wheat, oat, barley, corn, soybean, and tobacco. To examine the potential of WDIV to act as a viral vector, we modified the WDIV genome and cloned DNA fragments of the phytoene desaturase (PDS) genes from wheat and tobacco, separately. For gene editing experiments, tobacco lines expressing Cas9 were infiltrated with a WDIV-based vector carrying gRNA targeting the PDS gene. RESULTS: About 80 to 90\% of plants inoculated with infectious clones of WDIV alone or WDIV together with AYLCB showed mild symptoms, whereas some plants showed more prominent symptoms. WDIV and AYLCB were detected in the systemically infected leaves of all the plant species. Furthermore, the inoculation of the WDIV vector carrying PDS fragments induced silencing of the PDS gene in both wheat and tobacco plants. We also observed high-efficiency genome editing in the Cas9-expressing tobacco plants that were inoculated with WDIV vector-carrying gRNA. CONCLUSION: Detection of WDIV in naturally infected wheat, barley, and sugarcane in the field and its ability to systemically infect wheat, oat, barley, corn, soybean, and tobacco under laboratory conditions, provides compelling evidence that WDIV is the first geminivirus identified with the capability of infecting both monocot and dicot plant species. The wide host range of WDIV can be exploited for developing a single vector system for high-throughput genome editing in many plant species.",

abstract = "Reverse transcriptases, used in prime editing systems, exhibit lower fidelity, processivity and dNTP affinity than many DNA-dependent DNA polymerases. We report that a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (phi29), untethered from Cas9, enables editing from a synthetic, end-stabilized DNA-containing template at up to 60\% efficiency in human cells. Compared to prime editing, DNA polymerase editing avoids autoinhibitory intramolecular base pairing of the template, facilitates template synthesis and supports larger insertions (>100 nucleotides).",

abstract = "The rapid development of the CRISPR-Cas9, -Cas12a and -Cas12b genome editing systems has greatly fuelled basic and translational plant research1-6. DNA targeting by these Cas nucleases is restricted by their preferred protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs). The PAM requirement for the most popular Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) is NGG (N = A, T, C, G)7, limiting its targeting scope to GC-rich regions. Here, we demonstrate genome editing at relaxed PAM sites in rice (a monocot) and the Dahurian larch (a coniferous tree), using an engineered SpRY Cas9 variant8. Highly efficient targeted mutagenesis can be readily achieved by SpRY at relaxed PAM sites in the Dahurian larch protoplasts and in rice transgenic lines through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Furthermore, an SpRY-based cytosine base editor was developed and demonstrated by directed evolution of new herbicide resistant OsALS alleles in rice. Similarly, a highly active SpRY adenine base editor was developed based on ABE8e (ref. 9) and SpRY-ABE8e was able to target relaxed PAM sites in rice plants, achieving up to 79\% editing efficiency with high product purity. Thus, the SpRY toolbox breaks a PAM restriction barrier in plant genome engineering by enabling DNA editing in a PAM-less fashion. Evidence was also provided for secondary off-target effects by de novo generated single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) due to SpRY-mediated transfer DNA self-editing, which calls for more sophisticated programmes for designing highly specific sgRNAs when implementing the SpRY genome editing toolbox.",

abstract = "The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software has matured to contain a large collection of methods and tools of computational molecular evolution. Here, we describe new additions that make MEGA a more comprehensive tool for building timetrees of species, pathogens, and gene families using rapid relaxed-clock methods. Methods for estimating divergence times and confidence intervals are implemented to use probability densities for calibration constraints for node-dating and sequence sampling dates for tip-dating analyses. They are supported by new options for tagging sequences with spatiotemporal sampling information, an expanded interactive Node Calibrations Editor, and an extended Tree Explorer to display timetrees. Also added is a Bayesian method for estimating neutral evolutionary probabilities of alleles in a species using multispecies sequence alignments and a machine learning method to test for the autocorrelation of evolutionary rates in phylogenies. The computer memory requirements for the maximum likelihood analysis are reduced significantly through reprogramming, and the graphical user interface has been made more responsive and interactive for very big data sets. These enhancements will improve the user experience, quality of results, and the pace of biological discovery. Natively compiled graphical user interface and command-line versions of MEGA11 are available for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS from www.megasoftware.net.",

The relative frequencies of these pathways are thought to primarily depend on genomic sequence and cell state contexts, limiting control over mutational outcomes. Here, we report that engineered Cas9 nucleases that create different DNA break structures engage competing repair pathways at dramatically altered frequencies. We accordingly designed a Cas9 variant (vCas9) that produces breaks which suppress otherwise dominant nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair. Instead, breaks created by vCas9 are predominantly repaired by pathways utilizing homologous sequences, specifically microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR). Consequently, vCas9 enables efficient precise editing through HDR or MMEJ while suppressing indels caused by NHEJ in dividing and nondividing cells. These findings establish a paradigm of targeted nucleases custom-designed for specific mutational applications.",

Its de-novo-sequenced genome with 27,467 protein-coding genes includes distinct adaptations to abiotic stresses and comprises the largest number of fast-evolving genes under positive selection. The uplift of the study site in the last 65 million years has resulted in life-threatening UV-B radiation and drastically reduced temperatures, and we detected several of the molecular adaptations of Takakia to these environmental changes. Surprisingly, specific morphological features likely occurred earlier than 165 mya in much warmer environments.

abstract = "The most extreme environments are the most vulnerable to transformation under a rapidly changing climate. These ecosystems harbor some of the most specialized species, which will likely suffer the highest extinction rates. We document the steepest temperature increase (2010-2021) on record at altitudes of above 4,000 m, triggering a decline of the relictual and highly adapted moss Takakia lepidozioides. Its de-novo-sequenced genome with 27,467 protein-coding genes includes distinct adaptations to abiotic stresses and comprises the largest number of fast-evolving genes under positive selection. The uplift of the study site in the last 65 million years has resulted in life-threatening UV-B radiation and drastically reduced temperatures, and we detected several of the molecular adaptations of Takakia to these environmental changes. Surprisingly, specific morphological features likely occurred earlier than 165 mya in much warmer environments. Following nearly 400 million years of evolution and resilience, this species is now facing extinction.",

abstract = "Faithful transmission of the genetic information is essential in all living organisms. DNA replication is therefore a critical step of cell proliferation, because of the potential occurrence of replication errors or DNA damage when progression of a replication fork is hampered causing replicative stress. Like other types of DNA damage, replicative stress activates the DNA damage response, a signaling cascade allowing cell cycle arrest and repair of lesions. The replicative DNA polymerase $\epsilon$ (Pol $\epsilon$) was shown to activate the S-phase checkpoint in yeast in response to replicative stress, but whether this mechanism functions in multicellular eukaryotes remains unclear. Here, we explored the genetic interaction between Pol $\epsilon$ and the main elements of the DNA damage response in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We found that mutations affecting the polymerase domain of Pol $\epsilon$ trigger ATR-dependent signaling leading to SOG1 activation, WEE1-dependent cell cycle inhibition, and tolerance to replicative stress induced by hydroxyurea, but result in enhanced sensitivity to a wide range of DNA damaging agents. Using knock-down lines, we also provide evidence for the direct role of Pol $\epsilon$ in replicative stress sensing. Together, our results demonstrate that the role of Pol $\epsilon$ in replicative stress sensing is conserved in plants, and provide, to our knowledge, the first genetic dissection of the downstream signaling events in a multicellular eukaryote.",

abstract = "Cryptochromes (CRYs) are evolutionarily conserved blue-light receptors that evolved from bacterial photolyases that repair damaged DNA. Today, CRYs have lost their ability to repair damaged DNA; however, prior reports suggest that human CRYs can respond to DNA damage. Currently, the role of CRYs in the DNA damage response (DDR) is lacking, especially in plants. Therefore, we evaluated the role of plant CRYs in DDR along with UBP12/13 deubiquitinases, which interact with and regulate the CRY2 protein. We found that cry1cry2 was hypersensitive, while ubp12ubp13 was hyposensitive to UVC-induced DNA damage. Elevated UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and the lack of DNA repair protein RAD51 accumulation in cry1cry2 plants indicate that CRYs are required for DNA repair. On the contrary, CPD levels diminished and RAD51 protein levels elevated in plants lacking UBP12 and UBP13, indicating their role in DDR repression. Temporal transcriptomic analysis revealed that DDR-induced transcriptional responses were subdued in cry1cry2, but elevated in ubp12ubp13 compared to WT. Through transcriptional modeling of the time-course transcriptome, we found that genes quickly induced by UVC (15 min) are targets of CAMTA 1-3 transcription factors, which we found are required for DDR. This transcriptional regulation seems, however, diminished in the cry1cry2 mutant, indicating that CAMTAs are required for CRY2-mediated DDR. Furthermore, we observed enhanced CRY2-UBP13 interaction and formation of CRY2 nuclear speckles under UVC, suggesting that UVC activates CRY2 similarly to blue light. Together, our data reveal the temporal dynamics of the transcriptional events underlying UVC-induced genotoxicity and expand our knowledge of the role of CRY and UBP12/13 in DDR.",

abstract = "Plants are constantly exposed to a wide range of environmental genotoxic stress factors including obligatory exposure to UV radiation in sunlight. Here, we report the functional characterization of a DNA repair protein, AtPol$\lambda$, a homolog of mammalian DNA polymerase $\lambda$ in Arabidopsis, in relation to its role in repair of UV-B-induced DNA damage during early stages of seedling development. The abundance of the AtPol$\lambda$ transcript and the protein levels were distinctly increased in response to UV-B irradiation in 6-day-old wild-type seedlings. Growth of atpol$\lambda$ mutant seedlings, deficient in AtPol$\lambda$ expression, was more sensitive to UV-B radiation compared with wild-type plants when seeds were exposed to UV-B radiation before germination. The atpol$\lambda$ mutants showed accumulation of relatively higher amounts of DNA lesions than wild-type plants following UV-B exposure and were less proficient in repair of UV-induced DNA damage. Increased accumulation of AtPol$\lambda$ protein in UV-B-irradiated 6-day-old wild-type seedlings during the dark recovery period has indicated a possible role for the protein in repair of UV-B-induced lesions in the dark. Overexpression of AtPol$\lambda$ in the atpol$\lambda$ mutant line partially complemented the repair proficiency of UV-B-induced DNA damage. In vitro repair synthesis assays using whole-cell extracts from the wild-type and atpol$\lambda$ mutant line have further demonstrated the role of AtPol$\lambda$ in repair synthesis of UV-B-damaged DNA in the dark through an excision repair mechanism. Overall, our results have indicated the possible involvement of AtPol$\lambda$ in a plant's response for repair of UV-B-mediated DNA damage during seedling development.",

abstract = "Safeguarding of genome integrity is a key process in all living organisms. Due to their sessile lifestyle, plants are particularly exposed to all kinds of stress conditions that could induce DNA damage. However, very few genes involved in the maintenance of genome integrity are indispensable to plants' viability. One remarkable exception is the POLQ gene, which encodes DNA polymerase theta (Pol $\vartheta$), a non-replicative polymerase involved in trans-lesion synthesis during DNA replication and double-strand break (DSB) repair. The Arabidopsis tebichi (teb) mutants, deficient in Pol $\vartheta$, have been reported to display severe developmental defects, leading to the conclusion that Pol $\vartheta$ is required for normal plant development. However, this essential role of Pol $\vartheta$ in plants is challenged by contradictory reports regarding the phenotypic defects of teb mutants and the recent finding that rice (Oryza sativa) null mutants develop normally. Here we show that the phenotype of teb mutants is highly variable. Taking advantage of hypomorphic mutants for the replicative DNA polymerase epsilon, which display constitutive replicative stress, we show that Pol $\vartheta$ allows maintenance of meristem activity when DNA replication is partially compromised. Furthermore, we found that the phenotype of Pol $\vartheta$ mutants can be aggravated by modifying their growth conditions, suggesting that environmental conditions impact the basal level of replicative stress and providing evidence for a link between plants' responses to adverse conditions and mechanisms involved in the maintenance of genome integrity.",

Utilizing transcriptomic and genomic datasets across 357 species and 31 families, we scrutinize 18 flavonoid pathway genes and six regulatory genes spanning four transitions to betalain pigmentation. We examined evidence for hypotheses of wholesale gene loss, modified gene function, altered gene expression, and degeneration of the MBW (MYB-bHLH-WD40) trasnscription factor complex, within betalain-pigmented lineages. Our analyses reveal that most flavonoid synthesis genes remain conserved in betalain-pigmented lineages, with the notable exception of TT19 orthologs, essential for the final step in anthocyanidin synthesis, which appear to have been repeatedly and entirely lost. Additional late-stage flavonoid pathway genes upstream of TT19 also manifest strikingly reduced expression in betalain-pigmented species. Additionally, we find repeated loss and alteration in the MBW transcription complex essential for canonical anthocyanin synthesis. Consequently, the loss and exclusion of anthocyanins in betalain-pigmented species appear to be orchestrated through several mechanisms: loss of a key enzyme, downregulation of synthesis genes, and degeneration of regulatory complexes. These changes have occurred iteratively in Caryophyllales, often coinciding with evolutionary transitions to betalain pigmentation.",

In animals, ATR is an essential gene. Here, we find that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) atr-/- mutants were viable, fertile, and phenotypically wild-type in the absence of exogenous DNA damaging agents but exhibit altered expression of AtRNR1 (ribonucleotide reductase large subunit) and alteration of some damage-induced cell-cycle checkpoints. atr mutants were hypersensitive to hydroxyurea (HU), aphidicolin, and UV-B light but only mildly sensitive to gamma-radiation. G2 arrest was observed in response to gamma-irradiation in both wild-type and atr plants, albeit with slightly different kinetics, suggesting that ATR plays a secondary role in response to double-strand breaks. G2 arrest also was observed in wild-type plants in response to aphidicolin but was defective in atr mutants, resulting in compaction of nuclei and subsequent cell death. By contrast, HU-treated wild-type and atr plants arrested in G1 and showed no obvious signs of cell death. We propose that, in plants, HU invokes a novel checkpoint responsive to low levels of deoxynucleotide triphosphates.

abstract = "Recent studies have shown that Cas9-mediated CRISPR gene editing outcomes at junctions of chromosomal rearrangements are precise and predictable; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood due to lack of suitable assay system and analysis tool. Here we developed a customized computer program to take account of staggered Cas9 cleavage and to rapidly process large volumes of junctional sequencing reads from chromosomal rearrangements, including DNA-fragment inversions, duplications, and deletions. We also established a sensitive assay system using HPRT1 and DCK as reporters for cell growth during DNA-fragment editing by Cas9 with dual sgRNAs and found prominent large resections at junctions of chromosomal rearrangements. In addition, we found that knockdown of PolQ (encoding Pol$\vartheta$) results in increased large resections but decreased small deletions. We also found that the mechanisms for generating small deletions of 1bp and >1bp during DNA-fragment editing are different with regards to their opposite dependencies on Pol$\vartheta$ and Pol$\lambda$. Specifically, Pol$\vartheta$ suppresses 1bp deletions but promotes >1bp deletions, whereas Pol$\lambda$ promotes 1bp deletions but suppresses >1bp deletions. Finally, we found that Pol$\lambda$ is the main DNA polymerase responsible for fill-in of the 5' overhangs of staggered Cas9 cleavage ends. These findings contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DNA-fragment editing and have important implications for controllable, precise, and predictable gene editing. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

However, the mechanisms of HR in plants are still poorly understood.

DDRM1 contains an N-terminal BRCT (BRCA1 C-terminal) domain and a C-terminal RING (really interesting new gene) domain and is highly conserved in plants including mosses. The ddrm1 mutant is defective in HR and thus is hypersensitive to DNA-damaging reagents. Biochemical studies reveal that DDRM1 interacts with and ubiquitinates the transcription factor SOG1, a plant-specific master regulator of DNA damage responses. Interestingly, DDRM1-mediated ubiquitination promotes the stability of SOG1. Consistently, genetic data support that SOG1 functions downstream of DDRM1. Our study reveals that DDRM1-SOG1 is a plant-specific module for HR and highlights the importance of ubiquitination in HR.",

abstract = "DNA polymerase lambda (pol lambda) is a novel family X DNA polymerase that has been suggested to play a role in meiotic recombination and DNA repair. The recent demonstration of an intrinsic 5'-deoxyribose-5-phosphate lyase activity in pol lambda supports a function of this enzyme in base excision repair. However, the biochemical properties of the polymerization activity of this enzyme are still largely unknown. We have cloned and purified human pol lambda to homogeneity in a soluble and active form, and we present here a biochemical description of its polymerization features. In support of a role in DNA repair, pol lambda inserts nucleotides in a DNA template-dependent manner and is processive in small gaps containing a 5'-phosphate group. These properties, together with its nucleotide insertion fidelity parameters and lack of proofreading activity, indicate that pol lambda is a novel beta-like DNA polymerase. However, the high affinity of pol lambda for dNTPs (37-fold over pol beta) is consistent with its possible involvement in DNA transactions occurring under low cellular levels of dNTPs. This suggests that, despite their similarities, pol beta and pol lambda have nonredundant in vivo functions.",

abstract = "DNA polymerase lambda contains template-dependent (DNA polymerase) and template-independent (terminal transferase) activities. In this study we enzymologically characterized the terminal transferase activity of polymerase lambda (pol lambda-tdt). Pol lambda-tdt activity was strongly influenced by the nature of the 3'-terminal sequence of the DNA substrate, and it required a single-stranded (ss) DNA 3'-overhang of about 9-12 nucleotides for optimal activity. The strong preference observed for pyrimidine versus purine nucleotide incorporation was found to be due, at least partially, to a steric block imposed by the residue Tyr-505 in the active site of pol lambda. Pol lambda-tdt was found to be able to elongate a 3'-ssDNA end by two alternative mechanisms: first, a template-independent one resulting in addition of 1 or 2 nucleotides, and second, a template-dependent one where a homopolymeric tract as short as 3 nucleotides at the 3'-end could be used as a template to direct DNA polymerization by a looping back mechanism. Furthermore repetitive cycles of DNA synthesis resulted in the expansion of such a short homopolymeric terminal sequence. Most importantly we found that the proliferating cell nuclear antigen was able to selectively block the looping back mechanism while stimulating the single terminal nucleotide addition. Finally replication protein A completely suppressed the transferase activity of pol lambda while stimulating the polymerase activity, suggesting that proliferating cell nuclear antigen and replication protein A can coordinate the polymerase and the terminal transferase activities of pol lambda.",

abstract = "Recent studies have shown that Cas9-mediated CRISPR gene editing outcomes at junctions of chromosomal rearrangements are precise and predictable; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood due to lack of suitable assay system and analysis tool. Here we developed a customized computer program to take account of staggered Cas9 cleavage and to rapidly process large volumes of junctional sequencing reads from chromosomal rearrangements, including DNA-fragment inversions, duplications, and deletions. We also established a sensitive assay system using HPRT1 and DCK as reporters for cell growth during DNA-fragment editing by Cas9 with dual sgRNAs and found prominent large resections at junctions of chromosomal rearrangements. In addition, we found that knockdown of PolQ (encoding Pol$\vartheta$) results in increased large resections but decreased small deletions. We also found that the mechanisms for generating small deletions of 1bp and >1bp during DNA-fragment editing are different with regards to their opposite dependencies on Pol$\vartheta$ and Pol$\lambda$. Specifically, Pol$\vartheta$ suppresses 1bp deletions but promotes >1bp deletions, whereas Pol$\lambda$ promotes 1bp deletions but suppresses >1bp deletions. Finally, we found that Pol$\lambda$ is the main DNA polymerase responsible for fill-in of the 5' overhangs of staggered Cas9 cleavage ends. These findings contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DNA-fragment editing and have important implications for controllable, precise, and predictable gene editing. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

Despite rapid advances in the field, in vivo targeted transgene integration is still infeasible because current tools are inefficient, especially for non-dividing cells, which compose most adult tissues. This poses a barrier for uncovering fundamental biological principles and developing treatments for a broad range of genetic disorders. Based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology, here we devise a homology-independent targeted integration (HITI) strategy, which allows for robust DNA knock-in in both dividing and non-dividing cells in vitro and, more importantly, in vivo (for example, in neurons of postnatal mammals). As a proof of concept of its therapeutic potential, we demonstrate the efficacy of HITI in improving visual function using a rat model of the retinal degeneration condition retinitis pigmentosa. The HITI method presented here establishes new avenues for basic research and targeted gene therapies.",

abstract = "The availability of multiple genome-wide human polymorphism datasets has led to an increase in efforts to scan the genome for signals of positive selection. As a result, the number of loci in the human genome predicted to be adaptively evolving increases monthly. Yet, these numerous genome-wide scans have identified minimally overlapping sets of candidate loci, potentially due to biases in genotype versus sequence data or power of statistical tests to detect selection in different time frames. Because of these issues, a critical step is to confirm the evidence for positive selection through direct sequencing. In this study, we describe the resequencing and analysis of two loci, RAGE and POLL, that were identified by a recent genome-wide scan of the Perlegen data to be under selection in the Han Chinese population. By resequencing these loci in additional populations, we have found that the evolutionary history of these regions is more complex than observed in the initial genome-wide scan and that the sweep patterns are shared across several populations. The resequencing data provide evidence for selection on RAGE in the non-African populations and on POLL in the Asian and Sub-Saharan African populations. In addition to confirming the signatures of selection from the genome-wide scan, direct resequencing reveals more extensive patterns of selection than the genotype data.",

abstract = "In human cells, DNA double-strand breaks are repaired primarily by the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Given their critical nature, we expected NHEJ proteins to be evolutionarily conserved, with relatively little sequence change over time. Here, we report that while critical domains of these proteins are conserved as expected, the sequence of NHEJ proteins has also been shaped by recurrent positive selection, leading to rapid sequence evolution in other protein domains. In order to characterize the molecular evolution of the human NHEJ pathway, we generated large simian primate sequence datasets for NHEJ genes. Codon-based models of gene evolution yielded statistical support for the recurrent positive selection of five NHEJ genes during primate evolution: XRCC4, NBS1, Artemis, POL$\lambda$, and CtIP. Analysis of human polymorphism data using the composite of multiple signals (CMS) test revealed that XRCC4 has also been subjected to positive selection in modern humans. Crystal structures are available for XRCC4, Nbs1, and Pol$\lambda$; and residues under positive selection fall exclusively on the surfaces of these proteins. Despite the positive selection of such residues, biochemical experiments with variants of one positively selected site in Nbs1 confirm that functions necessary for DNA repair and checkpoint signaling have been conserved. However, many viruses interact with the proteins of the NHEJ pathway as part of their infectious lifecycle. We propose that an ongoing evolutionary arms race between viruses and NHEJ genes may be driving the surprisingly rapid evolution of these critical genes.",

abstract = "Entamoeba histolytica encodes four family B2 DNA polymerases that vary in amino acid length from 813 to 1279. These DNA polymerases contain a N-terminal domain with no homology to other proteins and a C-terminal domain with high amino acid identity to archetypical family B2 DNA polymerases. A phylogenetic analysis indicates that these family B2 DNA polymerases are grouped with DNA polymerases from transposable elements dubbed Polintons or Mavericks. In this work, we report the cloning and biochemical characterization of the smallest family B2 DNA polymerase from E. histolytica. To facilitate its characterization we subcloned its 660 amino acids C-terminal region that comprises the complete exonuclease and DNA polymerization domains, dubbed throughout this work as EhDNApolB2. We found that EhDNApolB2 displays remarkable strand displacement, processivity and efficiently bypasses the DNA lesions: 8-oxo guanosine and abasic site.Family B2 DNA polymerases from T. vaginalis, G. lambia and E. histolytica contain a Terminal Region Protein 2 (TPR2) motif twice the length of the TPR2 from $\varphi$29 DNA polymerase. Deletion studies demonstrate that as in $\varphi$29 DNA polymerase, the TPR2 motif of EhDNApolB2 is solely responsible of strand displacement and processivity. Interestingly the TPR2 of EhDNApolB2 is also responsible for efficient abasic site bypass. These data suggests that the 21 extra amino acids of the TPR2 motif may shape the active site of EhDNApolB2 to efficiently incorporate and extended opposite an abasic site. Herein we demonstrate that an open reading frame derived from Politons-Mavericks in parasitic protozoa encode a functional enzyme and our findings support the notion that the introduction of novel motifs in DNA polymerases can confer specialized properties to a conserved scaffold.",

Here, we describe an extremely simple cut-dip-budding (CDB) delivery system, which uses Agrobacterium rhizogene to inoculate explants, generating transformed roots that produce transformed buds due to root suckering. We have successfully used CDB to achieve the heritable transformation of plant species in multiple plant families, including two herbaceous plants (Taraxacum kok-saghyz and Coronilla varia), a tuberous root plant (sweet potato), and three woody plant species (Ailanthus altissima, Aralia elata, and Clerodendrum chinense). These plants have previously been difficult or impossible to transform, but the CDB method enabled efficient transformation or gene editing in them using a very simple explant dipping protocol, under non-sterile conditions and without the need for tissue culture. Our work suggests that large numbers of plants could be amenable to genetic modifications using the CDB method.",

abstract = "Successful regeneration of genetically modified plants from cell culture is highly dependent on the species, genotype, and tissue-type being targeted for transformation. Studies in some plant species have shown that when expression is altered, some genes regulating developmental processes are capable of triggering plant regeneration in a variety of plant cells and tissue-types previously identified as being recalcitrant to regeneration. In the present research, we report that developmental genes encoding GROWTH-REGULATING FACTORS positively enhance regeneration and transformation in both monocot and dicot species. In sugar beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris), ectopic expression of Arabidopsis GRF5 (AtGRF5) in callus cells accelerates shoot formation and dramatically increases transformation efficiency. More importantly, overexpression of AtGRF5 enables the production of stable transformants in recalcitrant sugar beet varieties. The introduction of AtGRF5 and GRF5 orthologs into canola (Brassica napus L.), soybean (Glycine max L.), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) results in significant increases in genetic transformation of the explant tissue. A positive effect on proliferation of transgenic callus cells in canola was observed upon overexpression of GRF5 genes and AtGRF6 and AtGRF9. In soybean and sunflower, the overexpression of GRF5 genes seems to increase the proliferation of transformed cells, promoting transgenic shoot formation. In addition, the transformation of two putative AtGRF5 orthologs in maize (Zea mays L.) significantly boosts transformation efficiency and resulted in fully fertile transgenic plants. Overall, the results suggest that overexpression of GRF genes render cells and tissues more competent to regeneration across a wide variety of crop species and regeneration processes. This sets GRFs apart from other developmental regulators and, therefore, they can potentially be applied to improve transformation of monocot and dicot plant species.",

One of the most conspicuous roles of the duo is conferring the meristematic potential on the proliferative and formative cells during organogenesis. GRF expression is post-transcriptionally down-regulated by microRNA396 (miR396), thus constructing the GRF-GIF-miR396 module and fine-tuning the duo's action. Since the last comprehensive review articles were published over three years ago, many studies have added further insight into its action and elucidated new biological roles. The current review highlights recent advances in our understanding of how the GRF-GIF-miR396 module regulates plant growth and development.

We now describe the GRF gene family of Arabidopsis thaliana (AtGRF), which comprises nine members. The deduced AtGRF proteins contain the same characteristic regions--the QLQ (Gln, Leu, Gln) and WRC (Trp, Arg, Cys) domains--as do OsGRF1 and related proteins in rice, as well as features indicating a function in transcriptional regulation. Most of the AtGRF genes are strongly expressed in actively growing and developing tissues, such as shoot tips, flower buds, and roots, but weakly in mature stem and leaf tissues. Overexpression of AtGRF1 and AtGRF2 resulted in larger leaves and cotyledons, as well as in delayed bolting of the inflorescence stem when compared to wild-type plants. In contrast, triple insertional null mutants of AtGRF1-AtGRF3 had smaller leaves and cotyledons, whereas single mutants displayed no changes in phenotype and double mutants displayed only minor ones. The alteration of leaf growth in overexpressors and triple mutants was based on an increase or decrease in cell size, respectively. These results indicate that AtGRF proteins play a role in the regulation of cell expansion in leaf and cotyledon tissues.",

Out of 17 DNA polymerases present in a mammalian cell, at least 13 are specifically devoted to DNA repair and are often acting in different pathways. DNA polymerases $\beta$ and $\lambda$ are involved in base excision repair of modified DNA bases and translesion synthesis past DNA lesions. Polymerase $\lambda$ also participates in non-homologous end joining of DNA double-strand breaks. However, recent data have revealed that, depending on their relative levels, the cell cycle phase, the ratio between deoxy- and ribo-nucleotide pools and the interaction with particular auxiliary proteins, the repair reactions carried out by these enzymes can be an important source of genetic instability, owing to repair mistakes.

abstract = "The mechanism of DNA polymerase (pol) fidelity is of fundamental importance in chemistry and biology. While high-fidelity pols have been well studied, much less is known about how some pols achieve medium or low fidelity with functional importance. Here we examine how human DNA polymerase $\lambda$ (Pol $\lambda$) achieves medium fidelity by determining 12 crystal structures and performing pre-steady-state kinetic analyses. We showed that apo-Pol $\lambda$ exists in the closed conformation, unprecedentedly with a preformed MgdNTP binding pocket, and binds MgdNTP readily in the active conformation in the absence of DNA. Since prebinding of MgdNTP could lead to very low fidelity as shown previously, it is attenuated in Pol $\lambda$ by a hydrophobic core including Leu431, Ile492, and the Tyr505/Phe506 motif. We then predicted and demonstrated that L431A mutation enhances MgdNTP prebinding and lowers the fidelity. We also hypothesized that the MgdNTP-prebinding ability could stabilize a mismatched ternary complex and destabilize a matched ternary complex, and provided evidence with structures in both forms. Our results demonstrate that, while high-fidelity pols follow a common paradigm, Pol $\lambda$ has developed specific conformations and mechanisms for its medium fidelity. Structural comparison with other pols also suggests that different pols likely utilize different conformational changes and microscopic mechanisms to achieve their catalytic functions with varying fidelities.",

In parallel experiments, surface accessibility maps for Arg residues were compared for the free fPollambda versus the binary complex of enzyme*gapped DNA and the ternary complex of enzyme*gapped DNA*dNTP (2'-deoxynucleotide triphosphate). These experiments suggested that fPollambda does not undergo major conformational changes during the catalysis in the solution phase. Furthermore, the mass spectrometry-based protein footprinting experiments revealed that active site residue R386 was shielded from the surface only in the presence of both a gapped DNA substrate and an incoming nucleotide. Site-directed mutagenesis and pre-steady-state kinetic studies confirmed the importance of R386 for the enzyme activity and indicated the key role for its guanidino group in stabilizing the negative charges of an incoming nucleotide and the leaving pyrophosphate product. We suggest that such interactions could be shared by and important for catalytic functions of other DNA polymerases.",

abstract = "The synthetic yeast genome constructed by the International Synthetic Yeast Sc2.0 consortium adds thousands of loxPsym recombination sites to all 16 redesigned chromosomes, allowing the shuffling of Sc2.0 chromosome parts by the Cre-loxP recombination system thereby enabling genome evolution experiments. Here, we present L-SCRaMbLE, a light-controlled Cre recombinase for use in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. L-SCRaMbLE allows tight regulation of recombinase activity with up to 179-fold induction upon exposure to red light. The extent of recombination depends on induction time and concentration of the chromophore phycocyanobilin (PCB), which can be easily adjusted. The tool presented here provides improved recombination control over the previously reported estradiol-dependent SCRaMbLE induction system, mediating a larger variety of possible recombination events in SCRaMbLE-ing a reporter plasmid. Thereby, L-SCRaMbLE boosts the potential for further customization and provides a facile application for use in the S. cerevisiae genome re-engineering project Sc2.0 or in other recombination-based systems.",

abstract = "CRISPR/Cas9 technology has the potential to significantly enhance plant breeding. To determine the specificity and the mutagenic spectrum of SpCas9 in tomato, we designed 89 g(uide) RNAs targeting genes of the tomato MYB transcription factor family with varying predicted specificities. Plasmids encoding sgRNAs and Cas9 were introduced into tomato protoplasts, and target sites as well as 224 predicted off-target sites were screened for the occurrence of mutations using amplicon sequencing. Algorithms for the prediction of efficacy of the sgRNAs had little predictive power in this system. The analysis of mutations suggested predictable identity of single base insertions. Off-target mutations were found for 13 out of 89 sgRNAs and only occurred at positions with one or two mismatches (at 14 and 3 sites, respectively). We found that PAM-proximal mismatches do not preclude low frequency off-target mutations. Off-target mutations were not found at all 138 positions that had three or four mismatches. We compared off-target mutation frequencies obtained with plasmid encoding sgRNAs and Cas9 with those induced by ribonucleoprotein (RNP) transfections. The use of RNPs led to a significant decrease in relative off-target frequencies at 6 out of 17, no significant difference at 9, and an increase at 2 sites. Additionally, we show that off-target sequences with insertions or deletions relative to the sgRNA may be mutated, and should be considered during sgRNA design. Altogether, our data help sgRNA design by providing insight into the Cas9-induced double-strand break repair outcomes and the occurrence of off-target mutations.",

abstract = "With thousands of patients worldwide, CAPN3 c.550delA is the most frequent mutation causing severe, progressive, and untreatable limb girdle muscular dystrophy. We aimed to genetically correct this founder mutation in primary human muscle stem cells. We designed editing strategies providing CRISPR-Cas9 as plasmid and mRNA first in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and applied this strategy then in primary human muscle stem cells from patients. Mutation-specific targeting yielded highly efficient and precise correction of CAPN3 c.550delA to wild type for both cell types. Most likely a single cut generated by SpCas9 resulted in a 5' staggered overhang of one base pair, which triggered an overhang-dependent base replication of an A:T at the mutation site. This recovered the open reading frame and the CAPN3 DNA sequence was repaired template-free to wild type, which led to CAPN3 mRNA and protein expression. Off-target analysis using amplicon sequencing of 43 in silico predicted sites demonstrates the safety of this approach. Our study extends previous usage of single cut DNA modification since our gene product has been repaired into the wild-type CAPN3 sequence with the perspective of a real cure.",

On the other hand, the same DNA pols can have partially overlapping roles, which could result in possible conflicts of functions, if the DNA pols are not properly regulated. DNA pol $\lambda$ is a typical example of such an enzyme. It is a multifunctional enzyme, endowed with special structural and biochemical properties, which make it capable of participating in different DNA repair pathways such as base excision repair, nonhomologous end joining, and translesion synthesis. However, when mutated or deregulated, DNA pol $\lambda$ can also be a source of genetic instability.

abstract = "DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) trigger a variety of cellular signaling processes, collectively termed the DNA-damage response (DDR), that are primarily regulated by protein kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM). Among DDR activated processes, the repair of DSBs by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is essential. The proper coordination of NHEJ factors is mainly achieved through phosphorylation by an ATM-related kinase, the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), although the molecular basis for this regulation has yet to be fully elucidated. In this study we identify the major NHEJ DNA polymerase, DNA polymerase lambda (Pol$\lambda$), as a target for both ATM and DNA-PKcs in human cells. We show that Pol$\lambda$ is efficiently phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs in vitro and predominantly by ATM after DSB induction with ionizing radiation (IR) in vivo. We identify threonine 204 (T204) as a main target for ATM/DNA-PKcs phosphorylation on human Pol$\lambda$, and establish that its phosphorylation may facilitate the repair of a subset of IR-induced DSBs and the efficient Pol$\lambda$-mediated gap-filling during NHEJ. Molecular evidence suggests that Pol$\lambda$ phosphorylation might favor Pol$\lambda$ interaction with the DNA-PK complex at DSBs. Altogether, our work provides the first demonstration of how Pol$\lambda$ is regulated by phosphorylation to connect with the NHEJ core machinery during DSB repair in human cells.",

abstract = "Oxidation of DNA is a frequent and constantly occurring event. One of the best characterized oxidative DNA lesions is 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxo-G). It instructs most DNA polymerases to preferentially insert an adenine (A) opposite 8-oxo-G instead of the appropriate cytosine (C) thus showing miscoding potential. The MutY DNA glycosylase homologue (MutYH) recognizes A:8-oxo-G mispairs and removes the mispaired A giving way to the canonical base excision repair that ultimately restores undamaged guanine (G). Here we characterize for the first time in detail a posttranslational modification of the human MutYH DNA glycosylase. We show that MutYH is ubiquitinated in vitro and in vivo by the E3 ligase Mule between amino acids 475 and 535. Mutation of five lysine residues in this region significantly stabilizes MutYH, suggesting that these are the target sites for ubiquitination. The endogenous MutYH protein levels depend on the amount of expressed Mule. Furthermore, MutYH and Mule physically interact. We found that a ubiquitination-deficient MutYH mutant shows enhanced binding to chromatin. The mutation frequency of the ovarian cancer cell line A2780, analyzed at the HPRT locus can be increased upon oxidative stress and depends on the MutYH levels that are regulated by Mule. This reflects the importance of tightly regulated MutYH levels in the cell. In summary our data show that ubiquitination is an important regulatory mechanism for the essential MutYH DNA glycosylase in human cells.",

In addition, the structures of two different binary complexes, one with an oligonucleotide primer and the other with an incoming ddATP-Co(2+) complex, show that the substrates and the two divalent ions in the catalytic site are positioned in TdT in a manner similar to that described for the human DNA polymerase beta ternary complex, suggesting a common two metal ions mechanism of nucleotidyl transfer in these two proteins. The inability of TdT to accommodate a template strand can be explained by steric hindrance at the catalytic site caused by a long lariat-like loop, which is absent in DNA polymerase beta. However, displacement of this discriminating loop would be sufficient to unmask a number of evolutionarily conserved residues, which could then interact with a template DNA strand. The present structure can be used to model the recently discovered human polymerase mu, with which it shares 43\% sequence identity.",

While mutation rates are often regarded as constant, variability in mutation rates has been observed at nearly every level-varying across mutation types, genome locations, gene functions, epigenomic contexts, environmental conditions, genotypes, and species. This mutation rate variation arises from differential rates of DNA damage, repair, and transposable element activation and insertion that together produce what is measured by DNA mutation rates. We review historical and recent investigations into the causes and consequences of mutation rate variability in plants by focusing on the mechanisms shaping this variation. Emerging mechanistic models point to the evolvability of mutation rate variation across genomes via mechanisms that target DNA repair, shaping the diversification of plants at phenotypic and genomic scales.",

However, since the mutation rate varies along a genome and this variation can be subject to selection, organisms might evolve lower mutation rates at loci where mutations are most deleterious or increased rates where mutations are most needed. In fact, mechanisms of targeted hypermutation are known in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. Here we review the main forces driving the evolution of local mutation rates and identify the main limiting factors. Both targeted hyper- and hypomutation can evolve, although the former is restricted to loci under very frequent positive selection and the latter is severely limited by genetic drift. Nevertheless, we show how an association of repair with transcription or chromatin-associated proteins could overcome the drift limit and lead to non-random hypomutation along the genome in most organisms.",

abstract = "Our concept of a stable genome is evolving to one in which genomes are plastic and responsive to environmental changes. Growing evidence shows that a variety of environmental stresses induce genomic instability in bacteria, yeast, and human cancer cells, generating occasional fitter mutants and potentially accelerating adaptive evolution. The emerging molecular mechanisms of stress-induced mutagenesis vary but share telling common components that underscore two common themes. The first is the regulation of mutagenesis in time by cellular stress responses, which promote random mutations specifically when cells are poorly adapted to their environments, i.e., when they are stressed. A second theme is the possible restriction of random mutagenesis in genomic space, achieved via coupling of mutation-generating machinery to local events such as DNA-break repair or transcription. Such localization may minimize accumulation of deleterious mutations in the genomes of rare fitter mutants, and promote local concerted evolution. Although mutagenesis induced by stresses other than direct damage to DNA was previously controversial, evidence for the existence of various stress-induced mutagenesis programs is now overwhelming and widespread. Such mechanisms probably fuel evolution of microbial pathogenesis and antibiotic-resistance, and tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance, all of which occur under stress, driven by mutations. The emerging commonalities in stress-induced-mutation mechanisms provide hope for new therapeutic interventions for all of these processes.",

Several polymerase domains are conserved among the B-family DNA polymerases from these organisms, suggesting that the B-family DNA polymerases evolved from a common ancestor. Eukaryotes retain at least three replicative B-family DNA polymerases, DNA polymerase $\alpha$, $\delta$, and $\epsilon$, and one translesion B-family DNA polymerase, DNA polymerase $\zeta$. Here, we present molecular evolutionary evidence that suggests DNA polymerase genes evolved through horizontal gene transfer between the viral and archaeal-eukaryotic lineages. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the B-family DNA polymerases from nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs), eukaryotes, and archaea suggest that different NCLDV lineages such as Poxviridae and Mimiviridae were involved in the evolution of different DNA polymerases (pol-$\alpha$-, $\delta$-, $\epsilon$-, and $\zeta$-like genes) in archaeal-eukaryotic cell lineages, putatively through horizontal gene transfer. These results support existing theories that link the evolution of NCLDVs and the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus.",

abstract = "Prime editing (PE) is a precision gene editing technology that enables the programmable installation of substitutions, insertions and deletions in cells and animals without requiring double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). The mechanism of PE makes it less dependent on cellular replication and endogenous DNA repair than homology-directed repair-based approaches, and its ability to precisely install edits without creating DSBs minimizes indels and other undesired outcomes. The capabilities of PE have also expanded since its original publication. Enhanced PE systems, PE4 and PE5, manipulate DNA repair pathways to increase PE efficiency and reduce indels. Other advances that improve PE efficiency include engineered pegRNAs (epegRNAs), which include a structured RNA motif to stabilize and protect pegRNA 3' ends, and the PEmax architecture, which improves editor expression and nuclear localization. New applications such as twin PE (twinPE) can precisely insert or delete hundreds of base pairs of DNA and can be used in tandem with recombinases to achieve gene-sized (>5 kb) insertions and inversions. Achieving optimal PE requires careful experimental design, and the large number of parameters that influence PE outcomes can be daunting. This protocol describes current best practices for conducting PE and twinPE experiments and describes the design and optimization of pegRNAs. We also offer guidelines for how to select the proper PE system (PE1 to PE5 and twinPE) for a given application. Finally, we provide detailed instructions on how to perform PE in mammalian cells. Compared with other procedures for editing human cells, PE offers greater precision and versatility, and can be completed within 2-4 weeks.",

abstract = "Harnessing CRISPR-Cas9 technology provides an unprecedented ability to modify genomic loci via DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction and repair. We analyzed nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair induced by Cas9 in budding yeast and found that the orientation of binding of Cas9 and its guide RNA (gRNA) profoundly influences the pattern of insertion/deletions (indels) at the site of cleavage. A common indel created by Cas9 is a 1-bp (+1) insertion that appears to result from Cas9 creating a 1-nt 5' overhang that is filled in by a DNA polymerase and ligated. The origin of +1 insertions was investigated by using two gRNAs with PAM sequences located on opposite DNA strands but designed to cleave the same sequence. These templated +1 insertions are dependent on the X-family DNA polymerase, Pol4. Deleting Pol4 also eliminated +2 and +3 insertions, which are biased toward homonucleotide insertions. Using inverted PAM sequences, we also found significant differences in overall NHEJ efficiency and repair profiles, suggesting that the binding of the Cas9:gRNA complex influences subsequent NHEJ processing. As with events induced by the site-specific HO endonuclease, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated NHEJ repair depends on the Ku heterodimer and DNA ligase 4. Cas9 events are highly dependent on the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex, independent of Mre11's nuclease activity. Inspection of the outcomes of a large number of Cas9 cleavage events in mammalian cells reveals a similar templated origin of +1 insertions in human cells, but also a significant frequency of similarly templated +2 insertions.",

abstract = "Post-translational modification of histones and DNA methylation are important components of chromatin-level control of genome activity in eukaryotes. However, principles governing the combinatorial association of chromatin marks along the genome remain poorly understood. Here, we have generated epigenomic maps for eight histone modifications (H3K4me2 and 3, H3K27me1 and 2, H3K36me3, H3K56ac, H4K20me1 and H2Bub) in the model plant Arabidopsis and we have combined these maps with others, produced under identical conditions, for H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and DNA methylation. Integrative analysis indicates that these 12 chromatin marks, which collectively cover ∼90\% of the genome, are present at any given position in a very limited number of combinations. Moreover, we show that the distribution of the 12 marks along the genomic sequence defines four main chromatin states, which preferentially index active genes, repressed genes, silent repeat elements and intergenic regions. Given the compact nature of the Arabidopsis genome, these four indexing states typically translate into short chromatin domains interspersed with each other. This first combinatorial view of the Arabidopsis epigenome points to simple principles of organization as in metazoans and provides a framework for further studies of chromatin-based regulatory mechanisms in plants.",

However, it is challenging to profile Cas9 activity in the endogenous cellular environment. Here we leverage our TRIP technology to integrate ~ 1k barcoded reporter genes in the genomes of mouse embryonic stem cells. We target the integrated reporters (IRs) using RNA-guided Cas9 and characterize induced mutations by sequencing. We report that gRNA-sequence and IR locus explain most variation in mutation efficiency. Predominant insertions of a gRNA-specific nucleotide are consistent with template-dependent repair of staggered DNA ends with 1-bp 5' overhangs. We confirm that such staggered ends are induced by Cas9 in mouse pre-B cells. To explain observed insertions, we propose a model generating primarily blunt and occasionally staggered DNA ends. Mutation patterns indicate that gRNA-sequence controls the fraction of staggered ends, which could be used to optimize Cas9-based insertion efficiency.",

abstract = "DNA methylation occurs in CG and non-CG sequence contexts. Non-CG methylation is abundant in plants and is mediated by CHROMOMETHYLASE (CMT) and DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE (DRM) proteins; however, its roles remain poorly understood. Here we characterize the roles of non-CG methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that a poorly characterized methyltransferase, CMT2, is a functional methyltransferase in vitro and in vivo. CMT2 preferentially binds histone H3 Lys9 (H3K9) dimethylation and methylates non-CG cytosines that are regulated by H3K9 methylation. We revealed the contributions and redundancies between each non-CG methyltransferase in DNA methylation patterning and in regulating transcription. We also demonstrate extensive dependencies of small-RNA accumulation and H3K9 methylation patterning on non-CG methylation, suggesting self-reinforcing mechanisms between these epigenetic factors. The results suggest that non-CG methylation patterns are critical in shaping the landscapes of histone modification and small noncoding RNA.",

abstract = "Nucleosome remodelers of the DDM1/Lsh family are required for DNA methylation of transposable elements, but the reason for this is unknown. How DDM1 interacts with other methylation pathways, such as small-RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM), which is thought to mediate plant asymmetric methylation through DRM enzymes, is also unclear. Here, we show that most asymmetric methylation is facilitated by DDM1 and mediated by the methyltransferase CMT2 separately from RdDM. We find that heterochromatic sequences preferentially require DDM1 for DNA methylation and that this preference depends on linker histone H1. RdDM is instead inhibited by heterochromatin and absolutely requires the nucleosome remodeler DRD1. Together, DDM1 and RdDM mediate nearly all transposon methylation and collaborate to repress transposition and regulate the methylation and expression of genes. Our results indicate that DDM1 provides DNA methyltransferases access to H1-containing heterochromatin to allow stable silencing of transposable elements in cooperation with the RdDM pathway.",

abstract = "DNA methylation in the non-CG context is widespread in the plant kingdom and abundant in mammalian tissues such as the brain and pluripotent cells. Non-CG methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana is coordinately regulated by DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE (DRM) and CHROMOMETHYLASE (CMT) proteins but has yet to be systematically studied in major crops due to difficulties in obtaining genetic materials. Here, utilizing the highly efficient multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing system, we created single- and multiple-knockout mutants for all the nine DNA methyltransferases in rice (Oryza sativa) and profiled their whole-genome methylation status at single-nucleotide resolution. Surprisingly, the simultaneous loss of DRM2, CHROMOMETHYLASE3 (CMT2), and CMT3 functions, which completely erases all non-CG methylation in Arabidopsis, only partially reduced it in rice. The regions that remained heavily methylated in non-CG contexts in the rice Os-dcc (Osdrm2/cmt2/cmt3a) triple mutant had high GC contents. Furthermore, the residual non-CG methylation in the Os-dcc mutant was eliminated in the Os-ddccc (Osdrm2/drm3/cmt2/cmt3a/cmt3b) quintuple mutant but retained in the Os-ddcc (Osdrm2/drm3/cmt2/cmt3a) quadruple mutant, demonstrating that OsCMT3b maintains non-CG methylation in the absence of other major methyltransferases. Our results showed that OsCMT3b is subfunctionalized to accommodate a distinct cluster of non-CG-methylated sites at highly GC-rich regions in the rice genome.",

We performed the experiments in a range of genetic backgrounds and using alternative CRISPR-Cas9 reagents. In total, we gathered data for >109 mutational outcomes. The majority of reproducible mutations are insertions of a single base, short deletions or longer microhomology-mediated deletions. Each gRNA has an individual cell-line-dependent bias toward particular outcomes. We uncover sequence determinants of the mutations produced and use these to derive a predictor of Cas9 editing outcomes.

However, few agronomically important maize genes have been cloned and used for trait improvement, due to its complex genome and genetic architecture. Here, we integrated multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9-based high-throughput targeted mutagenesis with genetic mapping and genomic approaches to successfully target 743 candidate genes corresponding to traits relevant for agronomy and nutrition. After low-cost barcode-based deep sequencing, 412 edited sequences covering 118 genes were precisely identified from individuals showing clear phenotypic changes. The profiles of the associated gene-editing events were similar to those identified in human cell lines and consequently are predictable using an existing algorithm originally designed for human studies. We observed unexpected but frequent homology-directed repair through endogenous templates that was likely caused by spatial contact between distinct chromosomes. Based on the characterization and interpretation of gene function from several examples, we demonstrate that the integration of forward and reverse genetics via a targeted mutagenesis library promises rapid validation of important agronomic genes for crops with complex genomes. Beyond specific findings, this study also guides further optimization of high-throughput CRISPR experiments in plants.",

A few months later, Chang and I reported that genes from unrelated bacterial species can be combined and propagated using the same approach and that interspecies recombinant DNA molecules can produce a biologically functional protein in a foreign host. Soon afterward, Boyer's laboratory and mine published our collaborative discovery that even genes from animal cells can be cloned in bacteria. These three PNAS papers quickly led to the use of DNA cloning methods in multiple areas of the biological and chemical sciences. They also resulted in a highly public controversy about the potential hazards of laboratory manipulation of genetic material, a decision by Stanford University and the University of California to seek patents on the technology that Boyer and I had invented, and the application of DNA cloning methods for commercial purposes. In the 40 years that have passed since publication of our findings, use of DNA cloning has produced insights about the workings of genes and cells in health and disease and has altered the nature of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries.

The lengths of the labeled fragments then identify the positions of that base. We describe reactions that cleave DNA preferentially at guanines, at adenines, at cytosines and thymines equally, and at cytosines alone. When the products of these four reactions are resolved by size, by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel, the DNA sequence can be read from the pattern of radioactive bands. The technique will permit sequencing of at least 100 bases from the point of labeling.",

abstract = "Living organisms are continuously exposed to a myriad of DNA damaging agents that can impact health and modulate disease-states. However, robust DNA repair and damage-bypass mechanisms faithfully protect the DNA by either removing or tolerating the damage to ensure an overall survival. Deviations in this fine-tuning are known to destabilize cellular metabolic homeostasis, as exemplified in diverse cancers where disruption or deregulation of DNA repair pathways results in genome instability. Because routinely used biological, physical and chemical agents impact human health, testing their genotoxicity and regulating their use have become important. In this introductory review, we will delineate mechanisms of DNA damage and the counteracting repair/tolerance pathways to provide insights into the molecular basis of genotoxicity in cells that lays the foundation for subsequent articles in this issue.

In addition to their fundamental role in maintaining genome integrity during replication and repair, DNA polymerases are widely used for DNA manipulation in vitro, including DNA cloning, sequencing, labeling, mutagenesis, and other purposes. The fundamental ability of DNA polymerases to synthesize a deoxyribonucleotide chain is conserved. However, the more specific properties, including processivity, fidelity (synthesis accuracy), and substrate nucleotide selectivity, differ among the enzymes. The distinctive properties of each DNA polymerase may lead to the potential development of unique reagents, and therefore searching for novel DNA polymerase has been one of the major focuses in this research field. In addition, protein engineering techniques to create mutant or artificial DNA polymerases have been successfully developing powerful DNA polymerases, suitable for specific purposes among the many kinds of DNA manipulations. Thermostable DNA polymerases are especially important for PCR-related techniques in molecular biology.

abstract = "Agrobacterium species transfer DNA (T-DNA) to plant cells where it may integrate into plant chromosomes. The process of integration is thought to involve invasion and ligation of T-DNA, or its copying, into nicks or breaks in the host genome. Integrated T-DNA often contains, at its junctions with plant DNA, deletions of T-DNA or plant DNA, filler DNA, and/or microhomology between T-DNA and plant DNA pre-integration sites. T-DNA integration is also often associated with major plant genome rearrangements, including inversions and translocations. These characteristics are similar to those often found after repair of DNA breaks, and thus DNA repair mechanisms have frequently been invoked to explain the mechanism of T-DNA integration. However, the involvement of specific plant DNA repair proteins and Agrobacterium proteins in integration remains controversial, with numerous contradictory results reported in the literature. In this review I discuss this literature and comment on many of these studies. I conclude that either multiple known DNA repair pathways can be used for integration, or that some yet unknown pathway must exist to facilitate T-DNA integration into the plant genome.",

abstract = "Delivery of genome editing reagents using CRISPR-Cas ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) transfection offers several advantages over plasmid DNA-based delivery methods, including reduced off-target editing effects, mitigation of random integration of non-native DNA fragments, independence of vector constructions, and less regulatory restrictions. Compared to the use in animal systems, RNP-mediated genome editing is still at the early development stage in plants. In this study, we established an efficient and simplified protoplast-based genome editing platform for CRISPR-Cas RNP delivery, and then evaluated the efficiency, specificity, and temperature sensitivity of six Cas9 and Cas12a proteins. Our results demonstrated that Cas9 and Cas12a RNP delivery resulted in genome editing frequencies (8.7--41.2\%) at various temperature conditions, 22°C, 26°C, and 37°C, with no significant temperature sensitivity. LbCas12a often exhibited the highest activities, while AsCas12a demonstrated higher sequence specificity. The high activities of CRISPR-Cas RNPs at 22° and 26°C, the temperature preferred by plant transformation and tissue culture, led to high mutagenesis efficiencies (34.0--85.2\%) in the protoplast-regenerated calli and plants with the heritable mutants recovered in the next generation. This RNP delivery approach was further extended to pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), soybean (Glycine max) and Setaria viridis with up to 70.2\% mutagenesis frequency. Together, this study sheds light on the choice of RNP reagents to achieve efficient transgene-free genome editing in plants.",

abstract = "In recent years, Setaria viridis has been developed as a model plant to better understand the C4 photosynthetic pathway in major crops. With the increasing availability of genomic resources for S. viridis research, highly efficient genome editing technologies are needed to create genetic variation resources for functional genomics. Here, we developed a protoplast assay to rapidly optimize the multiplexed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas9) system in S. viridis. Targeted mutagenesis efficiency was further improved by an average of 1.4-fold with the exonuclease, Trex2. Distinctive mutation profiles were found in the Cas9\_Trex2 samples, with 94\% of deletions larger than 10 bp, and essentially no insertions at all tested target sites. Further analyses indicated that 52.2\% of deletions induced by Cas9\_Trex2, as opposed to 3.5\% by Cas9 alone, were repaired through microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) rather than the canonical non-homologous end joining DNA repair pathway. Combined with a robust Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method with more than 90\% efficiency, the multiplex CRISPR/Cas9\_Trex2 system was demonstrated to induce targeted mutations in two tightly linked genes, svDrm1a and svDrm1b, at a frequency ranging from 73\% to 100\% in T0 plants. These mutations were transmitted to at least 60\% of the transgene-free T1 plants, with 33\% of them containing bi-allelic or homozygous mutations in both genes. This highly efficient multiplex CRISPR/Cas9\_Trex2 system makes it possible to create a large mutant resource for S. viridis in a rapid and high throughput manner, and has the potential to be widely applicable in achieving more predictable and deletion-only MMEJ-mediated mutations in many plant species.",

abstract = "Genome editing by RNA-guided nucleases, such as SpCas9, has been used in numerous different plant species. However, to what extent multiple independent loci can be targeted simultaneously by multiplexing has not been well documented. Here, we developed a toolkit, based on a highly intron-optimized zCas9i gene, which allows assembly of nuclease constructs expressing up to 32 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). We used this toolkit to explore the limits of multiplexing in two major model species, and report on the isolation of transgene-free octuple (8$\times$) Nicotiana benthamiana and duodecuple (12$\times$) Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lines in a single generation (T1 and T2 , respectively). We developed novel counter-selection markers for N. benthamiana, most importantly Sl-FAST2, comparable to the well-established Arabidopsis seed fluorescence marker, and FCY-UPP, based on the production of toxic 5-fluorouracil in the presence of a precursor. Targeting eight genes with an array of nine different sgRNAs and relying on FCY-UPP for selection of non-transgenic T1 , we identified N. benthamiana mutant lines with astonishingly high efficiencies: All analyzed plants carried mutations in all genes (approximately 112/116 target sites edited). Furthermore, we targeted 12 genes by an array of 24 sgRNAs in A. thaliana. Efficiency was significantly lower in A. thaliana, and our results indicate Cas9 availability is the limiting factor in such higher-order multiplexing applications. We identified a duodecuple mutant line by a combination of phenotypic screening and amplicon sequencing. The resources and results presented provide new perspectives for how multiplexing can be used to generate complex genotypes or to functionally interrogate groups of candidate genes.",

Little homology is seen between the amino acid sequences of the presumptive N-terminal chloroplast transit peptides. Both plant genes lack introns. The tobacco ALS gene was isolated from a line of tobacco which is resistant to the sulfonylurea herbicides due to an alteration in ALS.

To this end, we developed a novel vector system for chloroplast transformation with acetolactate synthase (ALS). ALS catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of the branched amino acids, and its enzymatic activity is inhibited by certain classes of herbicides. We generated a series of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutated ALS (mALS) genes and introduced constructs with mALS and the aminoglycoside 3'-adenyltransferase gene (aadA) into the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) chloroplast genome by particle bombardment. Transplastomic plants were selected using their resistance to spectinomycin. The effects of herbicides on transplastomic mALS activity were examined by a colorimetric assay using the leaves of transplastomic plants. We found that transplastomic G121A, A122V, and P197S plants were specifically tolerant to pyrimidinylcarboxylate, imidazolinon, and sulfonylurea/pyrimidinylcarboxylate herbicides, respectively. Transplastomic plants possessing mALSs were able to grow in the presence of various herbicides, thus affirming the relationship between mALSs and the associated resistance to herbicides. Our results show that mALS genes integrated into the chloroplast genome are useful sustainable markers that function to exclude plants other than those that are GM while maintaining transplastomic crops. This investigation suggests that the resistance management of weeds in the field amid growing GM crops is possible using (1) a series of mALSs that confer specific resistance to herbicides and (2) a strategy that employs herbicide rotation.",

abstract = "Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) inhibitor herbicides currently comprise the largest site-of-action group (with 54 active ingredients across five chemical groups) and have been widely used in world agriculture since they were first introduced in 1982. Resistance evolution in weeds to AHAS inhibitors has been rapid and identified in populations of many weed species. Often, evolved resistance is associated with point mutations in the target AHAS gene; however non-target-site enhanced herbicide metabolism occurs as well. Many AHAS gene resistance mutations can occur and be rapidly enriched owing to a high initial resistance gene frequency, simple and dominant genetic inheritance and lack of major fitness cost of the resistance alleles. Major advances in the elucidation of the crystal structure of the AHAS (Arabidopsis thaliana) catalytic subunit in complex with various AHAS inhibitor herbicides have greatly improved current understanding of the detailed molecular interactions between AHAS, cofactors and herbicides. Compared with target-site resistance, non-target-site resistance to AHAS inhibitor herbicides is less studied and hence less understood. In a few well-studied cases, non-target-site resistance is due to enhanced rates of herbicide metabolism (metabolic resistance), mimicking that occurring in tolerant crop species and often involving cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. However, the specific herbicide-metabolising, resistance-endowing genes are yet to be identified in resistant weed species. The current state of mechanistic understanding of AHAS inhibitor herbicide resistance is reviewed, and outstanding research issues are outlined.",

The democratization and widespread use of genome editing was enabled by the discovery of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 nuclease system. While genome editing using ZFNs and TALENs has already reached clinical trials, the pace at which genome editing enters human trials is bound to accelerate in the next several years with multiple promising preclinical studies heralding cures for monogenic diseases that are currently difficult to manage or even incurable.

abstract = "Intracellular signaling pathways are mediated by changes in protein abundance and post-translational modifications. A common approach for investigating signaling mechanisms and the effects induced by synthetic compounds is through overexpression of recombinant reporter genes. Genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9 offers a means to better preserve native biology by appending reporters directly onto the endogenous genes. An optimal reporter for this purpose would be small to negligibly influence intracellular processes, be readily linked to the endogenous genes with minimal experimental effort, and be sensitive enough to detect low expressing proteins. HiBiT is a 1.3 kDa peptide (11 amino acids) capable of producing bright and quantitative luminescence through high affinity complementation (KD = 700 pM) with an 18 kDa subunit derived from NanoLuc (LgBiT). Using CRISPR/Cas9, we demonstrate that HiBiT can be rapidly and efficiently integrated into the genome to serve as a reporter tag for endogenous proteins. Without requiring clonal isolation of the edited cells, we were able to quantify changes in abundance of the hypoxia inducible factor 1A (HIF1$\alpha$) and several of its downstream transcriptional targets in response to various stimuli. In combination with fluorescent antibodies, we further used HiBiT to directly correlate HIF1$\alpha$ levels with the hydroxyproline modification that mediates its degradation. These results demonstrate the ability to efficiently tag endogenous proteins with a small luminescent peptide, allowing sensitive quantitation of the response dynamics in their regulated expression and covalent modifications.",

abstract = "Protein-fragment complementation assays (PCAs) are widely used for investigating protein interactions. However, the fragments used are structurally compromised and have not been optimized nor thoroughly characterized for accurately assessing these interactions. We took advantage of the small size and bright luminescence of NanoLuc to engineer a new complementation reporter (NanoBiT). By design, the NanoBiT subunits (i.e., 1.3 kDa peptide, 18 kDa polypeptide) weakly associate so that their assembly into a luminescent complex is dictated by the interaction characteristics of the target proteins onto which they are appended. To ascertain their general suitability for measuring interaction affinities and kinetics, we determined that their intrinsic affinity (KD = 190 $\mu$M) and association constants (kon = 500 M(-1) s(-1), koff = 0.2 s(-1)) are outside of the ranges typical for protein interactions. The accuracy of NanoBiT was verified under defined biochemical conditions using the previously characterized interaction between SME-1 $\beta$-lactamase and a set of inhibitor binding proteins. In cells, NanoBiT fusions to FRB/FKBP produced luminescence consistent with the linear characteristics of NanoLuc. Response dynamics, evaluated using both protein kinase A and $\beta$-arrestin-2, were rapid, reversible, and robust to temperature (21-37 °C). Finally, NanoBiT provided a means to measure pharmacology of kinase inhibitors known to induce the interaction between BRAF and CRAF. Our results demonstrate that the intrinsic properties of NanoBiT allow accurate representation of protein interactions and that the reporter responds reliably and dynamically in cells.",

Much of this knowledge comes from studies performed in bacteria, yeast, and mammals and has impacted research in plant systems. Two plant features should be mentioned. Plants differ from higher eukaryotes in that they lack a reserve germline and cannot avoid environmental stresses. Therefore, plants have evolved different strategies to sustain genome fidelity through generations and continuous exposure to genotoxic stresses. These strategies include the presence of unique or multiple paralogous genes with partially overlapping DNA repair activities. Yet, in spite (or because) of these differences, plants, especially Arabidopsis thaliana, can be used as a model organism for functional studies. Some advantages of this model system are worth mentioning: short life cycle, availability of both homozygous and heterozygous lines for many genes, plant transformation techniques, tissue culture methods and reporter systems for gene expression and function studies. Here, I provide a current understanding of DNA repair genes in plants, with a special focus on A. thaliana. It is expected that this review will be a valuable resource for future functional studies in the DNA repair field, both in plants and animals.",

abstract = "The genomic integrity of every organism is constantly challenged by endogenous and exogenous DNA-damaging factors. Mutagenic agents cause reduced stability of plant genome and have a deleterious effect on development, and in the case of crop species lead to yield reduction. It is crucial for all organisms, including plants, to develop efficient mechanisms for maintenance of the genome integrity. DNA repair processes have been characterized in bacterial, fungal, and mammalian model systems. The description of these processes in plants, in contrast, was initiated relatively recently and has been focused largely on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Consequently, our knowledge about DNA repair in plant genomes - particularly in the genomes of crop plants - is by far more limited. However, the relatively small size of the Arabidopsis genome, its rapid life cycle and availability of various transformation methods make this species an attractive model for the study of eukaryotic DNA repair mechanisms and mutagenesis. Moreover, abnormalities in DNA repair which proved to be lethal for animal models are tolerated in plant genomes, although sensitivity to DNA damaging agents is retained. Due to the high conservation of DNA repair processes and factors mediating them among eukaryotes, genes and proteins that have been identified in model species may serve to identify homologous sequences in other species, including crop plants, in which these mechanisms are poorly understood. Crop breeding programs have provided remarkable advances in food quality and yield over the last century. Although the human population is predicted to ``peak'' by 2050, further advances in yield will be required to feed this population. Breeding requires genetic diversity. The biological impact of any mutagenic agent used for the creation of genetic diversity depends on the chemical nature of the induced lesions and on the efficiency and accuracy of their repair. More recent targeted mutagenesis procedures also depend on host repair processes, with different pathways yielding different products. Enhanced understanding of DNA repair processes in plants will inform and accelerate the engineering of crop genomes via both traditional and targeted approaches.",

Here we describe an approach for global detection of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) introduced by RGNs and potentially other nucleases. This method, called genome-wide, unbiased identification of DSBs enabled by sequencing (GUIDE-seq), relies on capture of double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides into DSBs. Application of GUIDE-seq to 13 RGNs in two human cell lines revealed wide variability in RGN off-target activities and unappreciated characteristics of off-target sequences. The majority of identified sites were not detected by existing computational methods or chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). GUIDE-seq also identified RGN-independent genomic breakpoint 'hotspots'. Finally, GUIDE-seq revealed that truncated guide RNAs exhibit substantially reduced RGN-induced, off-target DSBs. Our experiments define the most rigorous framework for genome-wide identification of RGN off-target effects to date and provide a method for evaluating the safety of these nucleases before clinical use.",

Over the course of two and a half days, participants worked through a modular workflow for the use of CRISPR-Cas9 in a course-based (undergraduate) research experience (CURE) setting while discussing the barriers each of their institutions had to implementing such work, and how such barriers could be overcome. The result of the workshop was a team with newfound energy and confidence to implement CRISPR-Cas9 technology in their courses and the development of a community of undergraduate educators dedicated to supporting each other in the implementation of the workflow either in a CURE or modular format.

abstract = "Prime editing enables the introduction of virtually any small-sized genetic change without requiring donor DNA or double-strand breaks. However, evaluation of prime editing efficiency requires time-consuming experiments, and the factors that affect efficiency have not been extensively investigated. In this study, we performed high-throughput evaluation of prime editor 2 (PE2) activities in human cells using 54,836 pairs of prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs) and their target sequences. The resulting data sets allowed us to identify factors affecting PE2 efficiency and to develop three computational models to predict pegRNA efficiency. For a given target sequence, the computational models predict efficiencies of pegRNAs with different lengths of primer binding sites and reverse transcriptase templates for edits of various types and positions. Testing the accuracy of the predictions using test data sets that were not used for training, we found Spearman's correlations between 0.47 and 0.81. Our computational models and information about factors affecting PE2 efficiency will facilitate practical application of prime editing.",

Initial successes have inspired efforts to discover new systems for targeting and manipulating nucleic acids, including those from Cas9, Cas12, Cascade and Cas13 orthologues. Genome editing by CRISPR-Cas can utilize non-homologous end joining and homology-directed repair for DNA repair, as well as single-base editing enzymes.

Nuclease-inactive and RNA-targeting Cas proteins have been fused to a plethora of effector proteins to regulate gene expression, epigenetic modifications and chromatin interactions.

Here we report the identification and analysis of a T-DNA insertion mutant of PDS3 gene. Functional complementation confirmed that both the albino and dwarf phenotypes of the pds3 mutant resulted from functional disruption of the PDS3 gene. Chloroplast development was arrested at the proplastid stage in the pds3 mutant. Further analysis showed that high level of phytoene was accumulated in the pds3 mutant. Addition of exogenous GA(3) could partially rescue the dwarf phenotype, suggesting that the dwarf phenotype of the pds3 mutant might be due to GA deficiency. Microarray and RT-PCR analysis showed that disrupting PDS3 gene resulted in gene expression changes involved in at least 20 metabolic pathways, including the inhibition of many genes in carotenoid, chlorophyll, and GA biosynthesis pathways. Our data suggest that the accumulated phytoene in the pds3 mutant might play an important role in certain negative feedbacks to affect gene expression of diverse cellular pathways.",

abstract = "Carotenoids are C40 tetraterpenoids synthesized by nuclear-encoded multienzyme complexes located in the plastids of higher plants. To understand further the components and mechanisms involved in carotenoid synthesis, we screened Arabidopsis for mutations that disrupt this pathway and cause accumulation of biosynthetic intermediates. Here, we report the identification and characterization of two nonallelic albino mutations, pds1 and pds2 (for phytoene desaturation), that are disrupted in phytoene desaturation and as a result accumulate phytoene, the first C40 compound of the pathway. Surprisingly, neither mutation maps to the locus encoding the phytoene desaturase enzyme, indicating that the products of at least three loci are required for phytoene desaturation in higher plants. Because phytoene desaturase catalyzes an oxidation reaction, it has been suggested that components of an electron transport chain may be involved in this reaction. Analysis of pds1 and pds2 shows that both mutants are plastoquinone and tocopherol deficient, in addition to their inability to desaturate phytoene. Separate steps of the plastoquinone/tocopherol biosynthetic pathway are affected by these two mutations. The pds1 mutation affects the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase because it can be rescued by growth on the product but not the substrate of this enzyme, homogentisic acid and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, respectively. The pds2 mutation most likely affects the prenyl/phytyl transferase enzyme of this pathway. Because tocopherol-deficient mutants in the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus can synthesize carotenoids, our findings demonstrate conclusively that plastoquinone is an essential component in carotenoid synthesis. We propose a model for carotenoid synthesis in photosynthetic tissue whereby plastoquinone acts as an intermediate electron carrier between carotenoid desaturases and the photosynthetic electron transport chain.",

abstract = "Bacterial type II CRISPR-Cas9 systems have been widely adapted for RNA-guided genome editing and transcription regulation in eukaryotic cells, yet their in vivo target specificity is poorly understood. Here we mapped genome-wide binding sites of a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) from Streptococcus pyogenes loaded with single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Each of the four sgRNAs we tested targets dCas9 to between tens and thousands of genomic sites, frequently characterized by a 5-nucleotide seed region in the sgRNA and an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Chromatin inaccessibility decreases dCas9 binding to other sites with matching seed sequences; thus 70\% of off-target sites are associated with genes. Targeted sequencing of 295 dCas9 binding sites in mESCs transfected with catalytically active Cas9 identified only one site mutated above background levels. We propose a two-state model for Cas9 binding and cleavage, in which a seed match triggers binding but extensive pairing with target DNA is required for cleavage.",

abstract = "The design of optimal guide RNA (gRNA) sequences for CRISPR systems is challenged by the need to achieve highly efficient editing at the desired location (on-target editing) with minimal editing at unintended locations (off-target editing). Although laboratory validation should ideally be used to detect off-target activity, computational predictions are almost always preferred in practice due to their speed and low cost. Several studies have therefore explored gRNA-DNA interactions in order to understand how CRISPR complexes select their genomic targets. CHOPCHOP (https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/) leverages these developments to build a user-friendly web interface that helps users design optimal gRNAs. CHOPCHOP supports a wide range of CRISPR applications, including gene knock-out, sequence knock-in, and RNA knock-down.

abstract = "The popularity of CRISPR-based gene editing has resulted in an abundance of tools to design CRISPR-Cas9 guides. This is also driven by the fact that designing highly specific and efficient guides is a crucial, but not trivial, task in using CRISPR for gene editing. Here, we thoroughly analyse the performance of 18 design tools. They are evaluated based on runtime performance, compute requirements, and guides generated. To achieve this, we implemented a method for auditing system resources while a given tool executes, and tested each tool on datasets of increasing size, derived from the mouse genome. We found that only five tools had a computational performance that would allow them to analyse an entire genome in a reasonable time, and without exhausting computing resources. There was wide variation in the guides identified, with some tools reporting every possible guide while others filtered for predicted efficiency. Some tools also failed to exclude guides that would target multiple positions in the genome. We also considered two collections with over a thousand guides each, for which experimental data is available. There is a lot of variation in performance between the datasets, but the relative order of the tools is partially conserved. Importantly, the most striking result is a lack of consensus between the tools. Our results show that CRISPR-Cas9 guide design tools need further work in order to achieve rapid whole-genome analysis and that improvements in guide design will likely require combining multiple approaches.",

This system uses a small guide RNA (gRNA) to direct Cas9 endonuclease to a specific DNA site; thus, its targeting capability is largely constrained by the gRNA-expressing device. In this study, we developed a general strategy to produce numerous gRNAs from a single polycistronic gene. The endogenous tRNA-processing system, which precisely cleaves both ends of the tRNA precursor, was engineered as a simple and robust platform to boost the targeting and multiplex editing capability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. We demonstrated that synthetic genes with tandemly arrayed tRNA-gRNA architecture were efficiently and precisely processed into gRNAs with desired 5' targeting sequences in vivo, which directed Cas9 to edit multiple chromosomal targets. Using this strategy, multiplex genome editing and chromosomal-fragment deletion were readily achieved in stable transgenic rice plants with a high efficiency (up to 100\%). Because tRNA and its processing system are virtually conserved in all living organisms, this method could be broadly used to boost the targeting capability and editing efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 toolkits.",

We engineered the Moloney-murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase by removing its ribonuclease H domain and incorporated a viral nucleocapsid protein with nucleic acid chaperone activity. Each modification independently improved prime editing efficiency by ~1.8-3.4-fold in plant cells. When combined in our engineered plant prime editor (ePPE), the two modifications synergistically enhanced the efficiency of base substitutions, deletions and insertions at various endogenous sites by on average 5.8-fold compared with the original PPE in cell culture. No significant increase in byproducts or off-target editing was observed. We used the ePPE to generate rice plants tolerant to sulfonylurea and imidazolinone herbicides, observing an editing frequency of 11.3\% compared with 2.1\% using PPE.

abstract = "Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by preferential loss of the medium spiny neurons in the striatum. Using CRISPR/Cas9 and somatic nuclear transfer technology, we established a knockin (KI) pig model of HD that endogenously expresses full-length mutant huntingtin (HTT). By breeding this HD pig model, we have successfully obtained F1 and F2 generation KI pigs. Characterization of founder and F1 KI pigs shows consistent movement, behavioral abnormalities, and early death, which are germline transmittable. More importantly, brains of HD KI pig display striking and selective degeneration of striatal medium spiny neurons. Thus, using a large animal model of HD, we demonstrate for the first time that overt and selective neurodegeneration seen in HD patients can be recapitulated by endogenously expressed mutant proteins in large mammals, a finding that also underscores the importance of using large mammals to investigate the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and their therapeutics.",

This is especially true for their distinguishing characteristics and activity states. Here, we review the current knowledge on CRMs and breakthrough technologies enabling identification, characterization, and validation of CRMs; we compare the genomic distributions of CRMs with respect to their target genes between different plant species, and discuss the role of transposable elements harboring CRMs in the evolution of gene expression.

We find that IDN2 interacts with the heterotrimeric replication protein A (RPA) complex. Depletion of IDN2 or the diRNA binding ARGONAUTE2 leads to increased accumulation of RPA at DSB sites and mislocalization of the recombination factor RAD51.

abstract = "The ideotype is a theoretical model of an archetypal cultivated plant. Recent progress in genome editing is aiding the pursuit of this ideal in crop breeding. Breeding is relatively straightforward when the traits in question are monogenic in nature and show Mendelian inheritance. Conversely, traits with a diffuse, polygenic basis such as abiotic stress resistance are more difficult to harness. In recent years, many genes have been identified that are important for plant domestication and act by increasing yield, grain or fruit size or altering plant architecture. Here, we propose that (a) key monogenic traits whose physiology has been unveiled can be molecularly tailored to achieve the ideotype; and (b) wild relatives of crops harboring polygenic stress resistance genes or other traits of interest could be de novo domesticated by manipulating monogenic yield-related traits through state-of-the-art gene editing techniques. An overview of the genomic and physiological challenges in the world's main staple crops is provided. We focus on tomato and its wild Solanum (section Lycopersicon) relatives as a suitable model for molecular design in the pursuit of the ideotype for elite cultivars and to test de novo domestication of wild relatives.",

Although homologous recombination (HR)-mediated gene knock-in is well established, it cannot necessarily be applied in every cell type and organism because of variable HR frequencies. We recently reported an alternative method of gene knock-in, named the PITCh (Precise Integration into Target Chromosome) system, assisted by microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ). MMEJ harnesses independent machinery from HR, and it requires an extremely short homologous sequence (5-25 bp) for DSB repair, resulting in precise gene knock-in with a more easily constructed donor vector. Here we describe a streamlined protocol for PITCh knock-in, including the design and construction of the PITCh vectors, and their delivery to either human cell lines by transfection or to frog embryos by microinjection. The construction of the PITCh vectors requires only a few days, and the entire process takes ∼ 1.5 months to establish knocked-in cells or ∼ 1 week from injection to early genotyping in frog embryos.",

abstract = "Sequence-specific nucleases have been exploited to create targeted gene knockouts in various plants(1), but replacing a fragment and even obtaining gene insertions at specific loci in plant genomes remain a serious challenge. Here, we report efficient intron-mediated site-specific gene replacement and insertion approaches that generate mutations using the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system. Using a pair of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting adjacent introns and a donor DNA template including the same pair of sgRNA sites, we achieved gene replacements in the rice endogenous gene 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) at a frequency of 2.0\%. We also obtained targeted gene insertions at a frequency of 2.2\% using a sgRNA targeting one intron and a donor DNA template including the same sgRNA site. Rice plants harbouring the OsEPSPS gene with the intended substitutions were glyphosate-resistant. Furthermore, the site-specific gene replacements and insertions were faithfully transmitted to the next generation. These newly developed approaches can be generally used to replace targeted gene fragments and to insert exogenous DNA sequences into specific genomic sites in rice and other plants.",

abstract = "CRISPR/Cas12a is a single effector nuclease that, like CRISPR/Cas9, has been harnessed for genome editing based on its ability to generate targeted DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Unlike the blunt-ended DSB generated by Cas9, Cas12a generates sticky-ended DSB that could potentially aid precise genome editing, but this unique feature has thus far been underutilized. In the current study, we found that a short double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) repair template containing a sticky end that matched one of the Cas12a-generated DSB ends and a homologous arm sharing homology with the genomic region adjacent to the other end of the DSB enabled precise repair of the DSB and introduced a desired nucleotide substitution. We termed this strategy 'Ligation-Assisted Homologous Recombination' (LAHR). Compared to the single-stranded oligo deoxyribonucleotide (ssODN)-mediated homology directed repair (HDR), LAHR yields relatively high editing efficiency as demonstrated for both a reporter gene and endogenous genes. We found that both HDR and microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) mechanisms are involved in the LAHR process. Our LAHR genome editing strategy, extends the repertoire of genome editing technologies and provides a broader understanding of the type and role of DNA repair mechanisms involved in genome editing.",

abstract = "A direct somatic embryogenesis protocol was developed for four cultivars of Nicotiana species, by using leaf disc as an explant. Direct somatic embryogenesis of Nicotiana by using BAP and IAA has not been investigated so far. This method does not require formation of callus tissues which leads to somaclonal variations. The frequency of somatic embryogenesis was strongly influenced by the plant growth hormones. The somatic embryos developing directly from explant tissue were noticed after 6 d of culture. Somatic embryogenesis of a high frequency (87-96\%) was observed in cultures of the all four genotypes (Nicotiana tabacum, N. benthamiyana, N. xanthi, N. t cv petihavana). The results showed that the best medium for direct somatic embryogenesis was MS supplemented with 2.5 mg/l, 0.2 mg/l IAA and 2\% sucrose. Subculture of somatic embryos onto hormone free MS medium resulted in their conversion into plants for all genotypes. About 95\% of the regenerated somatic embryos germinated into complete plantlets. The plants showed morphological and growth characteristics similar to those of seed-derived plants. Explants were transformed using Agrobacterium tumifacious LBA4404 plasmid pCAMBIA1301 harboring the GUS gene. The regenerated transgenic plants were confirmed by PCR analysis and histochemical GUS assay. The transformation efficiency obtained by using the Agrobacterium- mediated transformation was more than 95\%. This method takes 6 wk to accomplish complete transgenic plants through direct somatic embryogenesis. The transgenic plantlets were acclimatized successfully with 98\% survival in greenhouse and they showed normal morphological characteristics and were fertile. The regeneration and transformation method described herein is very simple, highly efficient and fast for the introduction of any foreign gene directly in tobacco through direct somatic embryogenesis.",

Accordingly, researchers, funding agencies, and policy makers have largely dealt with these issues intuitively. We explain how use of ES/WGS challenges: (i) models under which informed consent is typically obtained; (ii) how harms associated with data sharing are considered; and (iii) the nature of obligations surrounding unanticipated findings.

While the research community shows willingness to engage with both ambivalent and supportive audiences about potentially disruptive technological advances, there is less enthusiasm for engaging with groups who hold deeply opposing views to such advances. 'Playing God' and 'tampering with nature' are popular examples of intrinsic objections often made in opposition to the development or use of novel genetic technologies. Historically appearing in arguments against the pursuit of genetically modified organisms in agriculture and food industries, intrinsic objections have previously been labelled by the science community as inconsistent, non-scientific, and vague. Now found in a range of innovation contexts, the domain of synthetic biology appears to attract such objections consistently. We present the findings from a large Australian study (N = 4593) which suggests 'playing God' objections and their variants can be multilayered and, at times, accompanied by meaningful information about risk perceptions. We use qualitative analysis of open-ended responses from an online survey to show how these objections are articulated in response to selected synthetic biology applications across environmental and health domains. Our research invites a rethink of how the synthetic biology community perceives, and engages with, people who express intrinsic objections. These people may additionally hold extrinsic concerns that may be potentially addressed, or at least reasonably considered, through dialogue. We offer some concluding remarks for engaging with publics who employ these types of arguments to communicate unease with aspects of technology development and use.",

It offers recommendations to ensure that America reaps the benefits of this developing field within appropriate ethical boundaries. The Bioethics Commission approached this task through inclusive and deliberative engagement with ethicists, scientists, engineers, and individuals in faith, business, and non-profit communities. It held three public meetings, both in and outside of Washington, D.C., created an open forum for dialogue, and heard many diverse voices. The Bioethics Commission found that synthetic biology offers extraordinary promise to create new products for clean energy, pollution control, and medicine, to revolutionize chemical production and manufacturing, and to create new economic opportunities. With this promise comes a duty to attend carefully to potential risks, be responsible stewards, and consider thoughtfully the implications for humans, other species, nature, and the environment. The Bioethics Commission concluded that synthetic biology is capable of significant but limited achievements posing limited risks. Future developments may raise further objections, but the Commission found no reason to endorse additional federal regulations or a moratorium on work in this field at this time. Instead, the Commission urges monitoring and dialogue between the private and public sectors to achieve open communication and cooperation. The Bioethics Commission recommends that the government, through a coordinated process or body within the Executive Office of the President, lead an ongoing review of developments, risks, opportunities, and oversight as this field grows. This review should be in consultation with relevant scientific, academic, international, and public communities, and whenever possible its results should be made public. It also recommends that reasonable risk assessment should precede any field release of synthetic organisms. It suggests support for public engagement, education, and dialogue to ensure public trust and avoid unnecessary limitations on science and social progress.",

Therefore, it is important to understand how the production of such RNAs are controlled. In addition to the three canonical DNA dependent RNA polymerases (Pol) Pol I, II and III, two non-redundant plant-specific RNA polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V, have been identified and shown to generate noncoding RNAs that are required for transcriptional gene silencing via the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. Thus, somewhat paradoxically, transcription is required for gene silencing. This paradox extends beyond plants, as silencing pathways in yeast, fungi, flies, worms, and mammals also require transcriptional machinery [4,5]. As plants have evolved specialized RNA polymerases to carry out gene silencing in a manner that is separate from the essential roles of Pol II, their characterization offers unique insights into how RNA polymerases facilitate gene silencing. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms of Pol IV and Pol V function, including their compositions, their transcripts, and their modes of recruitment to chromatin.",

abstract = "DNA methylation is essential for gene regulation, transposon silencing and imprinting. Although the generation of specific DNA methylation patterns is critical for these processes, how methylation is regulated at individual loci remains unclear. Here we show that a family of four putative chromatin remodeling factors, CLASSY (CLSY) 1-4, are required for both locus-specific and global regulation of DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Mechanistically, these factors act in connection with RNA polymerase-IV (Pol-IV) to control the production of 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (24nt-siRNAs), which guide DNA methylation. Individually, the CLSYs regulate Pol-IV-chromatin association and 24nt-siRNA production at thousands of distinct loci, and together, they regulate essentially all 24nt-siRNAs. Depending on the CLSYs involved, this regulation relies on different repressive chromatin modifications to facilitate locus-specific control of DNA methylation. Given the conservation between methylation systems in plants and mammals, analogous pathways may operate in a broad range of organisms.",

We show that Arabidopsis Pol IV and Pol V are composed of subunits that are paralogous or identical to the 12 subunits of Pol II. Four subunits of Pol IV are distinct from their Pol II paralogs, six subunits of Pol V are distinct from their Pol II paralogs, and four subunits differ between Pol IV and Pol V. Importantly, the subunit differences occur in key positions relative to the template entry and RNA exit paths. Our findings support the hypothesis that Pol IV and Pol V are Pol II-like enzymes that evolved specialized roles in the production of noncoding transcripts for RNA silencing and genome defense.",

Nicotiana benthamiana is a commonly used model plant for studying plant-pathogen interactions because it is host to numerous plant pathogens and because many research tools are available for this species. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system is one of several powerful tools available for targeted gene editing, a crucial strategy for analyzing gene function. Here, we demonstrate the use of various CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins for gene editing of N. benthamiana protoplasts, including Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9), Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), Francisella novicida Cas12a (FnCas12a), and nCas9-activation-induced cytidine deaminase (nCas9-Target-AID). We successfully mutated Phytoene Desaturase (PDS) and Ethylene Receptor 1 (ETR1) and the disease-associated genes RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase 6 (RDR6), and Suppressor of Gene Silencing 3 (SGS3), and confirmed that the mutated alleles were transmitted to progeny. sgs3 mutants showed the expected phenotype, including absence of trans-acting siRNA3 (TAS3) siRNA and abundant expression of the GFP reporter. Progeny of both sgs3 and rdr6 null mutants were sterile. Our analysis of the phenotypes of the regenerated progeny indicated that except for the predicted phenotypes, they grew normally, with no unexpected traits. These results confirmed the utility of gene editing followed by protoplast regeneration in N. benthamiana. We also developed a method for in vitro flowering and seed production in N. benthamiana, allowing the regenerants to produce progeny in vitro without environmental constraints.",

Our simple protocol eliminates the need for expensive equipment, chemical and enzymatic donor DNA modification or plasmid construction by using polyethylene glycol-calcium to deliver non-modified single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides and CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein into protoplasts. Plants regenerated via edited protoplasts achieved targeted insertion frequencies of up to 50.0\% in Nicotiana benthamiana and 13.6\% in rapid cycling Brassica oleracea without antibiotic selection. Using a 60-nt donor containing 27 nt in each homologous arm, 6 of 22 regenerated N. benthamiana plants showed targeted insertions, and one contained a precise insertion of a 6-bp Hind III site. The inserted sequences were transmitted to the next generation and invite the possibility of future exploration of versatile genome editing by targeted DNA insertion in plants. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

Protoplast transfection and regeneration systems are useful platforms for CRISPR/Cas mutagenesis and genome editing. In this study, we demonstrate the use of Cpf1 (Cas12a) and nCas9-activation-induced cytidine deaminase (nCas9-Target-AID) systems to mutagenize Nicotiana tabacum protoplasts and to regenerate plants harboring the resulting mutations. We analyzed 20 progeny plants of Cas12a-mediated phytoene desaturase (PDS) mutagenized regenerants, as well as regenerants from wild-type protoplasts, and confirmed that their genotypes were inherited in a Mendelian manner. We used a Cas9 nickase (nCas9)-cytidine deaminase to conduct C to T editing of the Ethylene receptor 1 (ETR1) gene in tobacco protoplasts and obtained edited regenerates. It is difficult to obtain homozygous edits of polyploid genomes when the editing efficiency is low. A second round of mutagenesis of partially edited regenerants (a two-step transfection protocol) allowed us to derive ETR1 fully edited regenerants without the need for sexual reproduction. We applied three different Cas systems (SaCas9, Cas12a, and nCas9-Traget AID) using either a one-step or a two-step transfection platform to obtain triply mutated and/or edited tobacco regenerants. Our results indicate that these three Cas systems can function simultaneously within a single cell.",

Setaria viridis is a model monocot species with a relatively compact genome that has limited transposable element content. CRISPR-based genome editing approaches were used to create loss-of-function alleles for the two putative functional DRM genes in S. viridis to probe the role of RdDM. Double mutant (drm1ab) plants exhibit some morphological abnormalities but are fully viable. Whole-genome methylation profiling provided evidence for wide-spread loss of methylation in CHH sequence contexts, particularly in regions with high CHH methylation in wild-type plants. Evidence was also found for locus-specific loss of CG and CHG methylation, even in some regions that lack CHH methylation. Transcriptome profiling identified genes with altered expression in the drm1ab mutants. However, the majority of genes with high levels ofCHH methylation directly surrounding the transcription start site or in nearby promoter regions in wild-type plants do not have altered expression in the drm1ab mutant even when this methylation is lost, suggesting limited regulation of gene expression by RdDM. Detailed analysis of the expression of transposable elements identified several transposons that are transcriptionally activated in drm1ab mutants. These transposons likely require active RdDM for maintenance of transcriptional repression.",

Four of these enzymes are dedicated to the production of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are ribonucleic acids with functions independent of their protein-coding potential. lncRNAs display a broad range of lengths and structures, but they are distinct from the small RNA guides of RNA interference (RNAi) pathways. lncRNAs frequently serve as structural, catalytic, or regulatory molecules for gene expression. They can affect all elements of genes, including promoters, untranslated regions, exons, introns, and terminators, controlling gene expression at various levels, including modifying chromatin accessibility, transcription, splicing, and translation. Certain lncRNAs protect genome integrity, while others respond to environmental cues like temperature, drought, nutrients, and pathogens. In this review, we explain the challenge of defining lncRNAs, introduce the machineries responsible for their production, and organize this knowledge by viewing the functions of lncRNAs throughout the structure of a typical plant gene.",

In Arabidopsis, the biogenesis of diRNAs requires the PI3 kinase ATR, RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), and Dicer-like proteins. Mutations in these proteins as well as in Pol V cause significant reduction in DSB repair efficiency. In Arabidopsis, diRNAs are recruited by Argonaute 2 (AGO2) to mediate DSB repair. Knock down of Dicer or Ago2 in human cells reduces DSB repair. Our findings reveal a conserved function for small RNAs in the DSB repair pathway. We propose that diRNAs may function as guide molecules directing chromatin modifications or the recruitment of protein complexes to DSB sites to facilitate repair.",

abstract = "Replacement of endogenous genes by homologous recombination is rare in plants; the majority of genetic modifications are the result of transforming DNA molecules undergoing random genomic insertion by way of non-homologous recombination. Factors that affect chromatin remodeling and DNA repair are thought to have the potential to enhance the frequency of homologous recombination in plants. Conventional tools to study the frequencies of genetic recombination often rely on stable transformation-based approaches, with these systems being rarely capable of high-throughput or combinatorial analysis. We developed a series of vectors that use chemiluminescent (LUC and REN) reporter genes to assay the relative frequency of homologous and non-homologous recombination in plants. These transient assay vectors were used to screen 14 candidate genes for their effects on recombination frequencies in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Over-expression of Arabidopsis genes with sequence similarity to SNM1 from yeast and XRCC3 from humans enhanced the frequency of non-homologous recombination when assayed using two different donor vectors. Transient N. benthamiana leaf systems were also used in an alternative assay for preliminary measurements of homologous recombination frequencies, which were found to be enhanced by over-expression of RAD52, MIM and RAD51 from yeast, as well as CHR24 from Arabidopsis. The findings for the assays described here are in line with previous studies that analyzed recombination frequencies using stable transformation. The assays we report have revealed functions in non-homologous recombination for the Arabidopsis SNM1 and XRCC3 genes, so the suppression of these genes' expression offers a potential means to enhance the gene targeting frequency in plants. Furthermore, our findings also indicate that plant gene targeting frequencies could be enhanced by over-expression of RAD52, MIM, CHR24, and RAD51 genes.",

A central element of this process are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), which in Arabidopsis thaliana are produced by a specialized RNA polymerase known as Pol V. Here we show that non-coding transcription by Pol V is controlled by preexisting chromatin modifications located within the transcribed regions. Most Pol V transcripts are associated with AGO4 but are not sliced by AGO4. Pol V-dependent DNA methylation is established on both strands of DNA and is tightly restricted to Pol V-transcribed regions. This indicates that chromatin modifications are established in close proximity to Pol V. Finally, Pol V transcription is preferentially enriched on edges of silenced transposable elements, where Pol V transcribes into TEs. We propose that Pol V may play an important role in the determination of heterochromatin boundaries.",

abstract = "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are highly cytotoxic lesions and pose a major threat to genome stability if not properly repaired. We and others have previously shown that a class of DSB-induced small RNAs (diRNAs) is produced from sequences around DSB sites. DiRNAs are associated with Argonaute (Ago) proteins and play an important role in DSB repair, though the mechanism through which they act remains unclear. Here, we report that the role of diRNAs in DSB repair is restricted to repair by homologous recombination (HR) and that it specifically relies on the effector protein Ago2 in mammalian cells. Interestingly, we show that Ago2 forms a complex with Rad51 and that the interaction is enhanced in cells treated with ionizing radiation. We demonstrate that Rad51 accumulation at DSB sites and HR repair depend on catalytic activity and small RNA-binding capability of Ago2. In contrast, DSB resection as well as RPA and Mre11 loading is unaffected by Ago2 or Dicer depletion, suggesting that Ago2 very likely functions directly in mediating Rad51 accumulation at DSBs. Taken together, our findings suggest that guided by diRNAs, Ago2 can promote Rad51 recruitment and/or retention at DSBs to facilitate repair by HR.",

Inherited defects in TCR cause severe clinical syndromes, including Cockayne syndrome (CS). The molecular mechanism of TCR and the molecular origin of CS have long remained enigmatic. Here we explore new advances in our understanding of how TCR complexes assemble through cooperative interactions between repair factors stimulated by RNAPII ubiquitylation. Mounting evidence suggests that RNAPII ubiquitylation activates TCR complex assembly during repair and, in parallel, promotes processing and degradation of RNAPII to prevent prolonged stalling. The fate of stalled RNAPII is therefore emerging as a crucial link between TCR and associated human diseases.",

In this work, we show that SIRT6 directly recognizes DNA damage through a tunnel-like structure that has high affinity for DSB. SIRT6 relocates to sites of damage independently of signaling and known sensors. It activates downstream signaling for DSB repair by triggering ATM recruitment, H2AX phosphorylation and the recruitment of proteins of the homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining pathways. Our findings indicate that SIRT6 plays a previously uncharacterized role as a DNA damage sensor, a critical factor in initiating the DNA damage response (DDR). Moreover, other Sirtuins share some DSB-binding capacity and DDR activation. SIRT6 activates the DDR before the repair pathway is chosen, and prevents genomic instability. Our findings place SIRT6 as a sensor of DSB, and pave the road to dissecting the contributions of distinct DSB sensors in downstream signaling.",

Depletion of MMS22L or TONSL from human cells causes a high level of double-strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication. Both proteins accumulate at stressed replication forks, and depletion of MMS22L or TONSL from cells causes hypersensitivity to agents that cause S phase-associated DSBs, such as topoisomerase (TOP) inhibitors. In this light, MMS22L and TONSL are required for the HR-mediated repair of replication fork-associated DSBs. In cells depleted of either protein, DSBs induced by the TOP1 inhibitor camptothecin are resected normally, but the loading of the RAD51 recombinase is defective. Therefore, MMS22L and TONSL are required for the maintenance of genome stability when unscheduled DSBs occur in the vicinity of DNA replication forks.",

However, here we show that blocking chromatin assembly, via knockdown of the histone chaperones ASF1 or CAF-1 or a mutation that prevents ASF1A binding to histones, hinders Rad51 loading onto ssDNA during homologous recombination. This is a consequence of reduced recruitment of the Rad51 loader MMS22L-TONSL to ssDNA, resulting in persistent RPA foci, extensive DNA end resection, persistent activation of the ATR-Chk1 pathway, and cell cycle arrest. In agreement, histones occupy ssDNA during DNA repair in yeast. We also uncovered DNA-PKcs-dependent DNA damage-induced ASF1A phosphorylation, which enhances chromatin assembly, promoting MMS22L-TONSL recruitment and, hence, Rad51 loading. We propose that transient assembly of newly synthesized histones onto ssDNA serves to recruit MMS22L-TONSL to efficiently form the Rad51 nucleofilament for strand invasion, suggesting an active role of chromatin assembly in homologous recombination.",

Most of these locations correspond to transposons and other repetitive and silent elements of the Arabidopsis genome. These sites also correspond to high levels of H3K27 monomethylation, and mutation of the catalytic SET domain is sufficient to cause the re-replication defect. Mutation of ATXR5 and ATXR6 also causes upregulation of transposon expression and has pleiotropic effects on plant development.

abstract = "CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing has been widely adopted for basic and applied biological research in eukaryotic systems. While many studies considered DNA sequences of CRISPR target sites as the primary determinant for CRISPR mutagenesis efficiency and mutation profiles, increasing evidence revealed the significant role of chromatin context. Nonetheless, most of the prior studies were limited by the lack of sufficient epigenetic resources and/or by only transiently expressing CRISPR-Cas9 in a short time window. In this study, we leveraged the wealth of high-resolution epigenomic resources in Arabidopsis thaliana to address the impact of chromatin features on CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis using stable transgenic plants. Our results indicated that DNA methylation and chromatin features could lead to significant variations in mutagenesis efficiency by up to 250 folds. Low mutagenesis efficiencies were mostly associated with repressive heterochromatic features. This repressive effect appeared to persist through cell divisions but could be alleviated through substantial reduction of DNA methylation at CRISPR target sites. Moreover, specific chromatin features, such as H3K4me1, H3.3, and H3.1, appear to be associated with significant variations in CRISPR-Cas9 mutation profiles reflected by the 1 bp insertion rates. Our findings provided strong evidence that specific chromatin features could have significant and lasting impacts on both CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis efficiency and DNA double strand break repair outcomes. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

In this study, we investigated the effect of the level of cytosine methylation on the outcome of CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutations at multiple Cas9 target sites in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells using Next-Generation Sequencing. 3. We found that high levels of promoter methylation, but not gene-body methylation, decreased the frequency of Cas9-mediated mutations. DNA methylation also influenced the ratio of insertions and deletions and potentially the type of Cas9 cleavage in a target-specific manner. In addition, we detected an over-representation of deletion events governed by a single 5'-terminal nucleotide at Cas9-induced DNA breaks. 4. Our findings suggest that DNA methylation can indirectly impair Cas9 activity and subsequent DNA repair, likely through changes in the local chromatin structure. In addition to the well-described Cas9-induced blunt-end double-stranded DNA breaks, we provide evidence for Cas9-mediated staggered DNA cuts in plant cells. Both types of cut may direct microhomology-mediated DNA repair by a novel, yet undescribed, mechanism.",

abstract = "The targeted deletion, replacement, integration or inversion of genomic sequences could be used to study or treat human genetic diseases, but existing methods typically require double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) that lead to undesired consequences, including uncontrolled indel mixtures and chromosomal abnormalities. Here we describe twin prime editing (twinPE), a DSB-independent method that uses a prime editor protein and two prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs) for the programmable replacement or excision of DNA sequences at endogenous human genomic sites. The two pegRNAs template the synthesis of complementary DNA flaps on opposing strands of genomic DNA, which replace the endogenous DNA sequence between the prime-editor-induced nick sites. When combined with a site-specific serine recombinase, twinPE enabled targeted integration of gene-sized DNA plasmids (>5,000 bp) and targeted sequence inversions of 40 kb in human cells. TwinPE expands the capabilities of precision gene editing and might synergize with other tools for the correction or complementation of large or complex human pathogenic alleles. Prime editing of large DNA sequences is achieved with two pegRNAs and site-specific recombinases.",

abstract = "Environmental stress leads to dramatic transcriptional reprogramming, which is central to plant survival. Although substantial knowledge has accumulated on how a few plant cis-regulatory elements (CREs) function in stress regulation, many more CREs remain to be discovered. In addition, the plant stress cis-regulatory code, i.e., how CREs work independently and/or in concert to specify stress-responsive transcription, is mostly unknown. On the basis of gene expression patterns under multiple stresses, we identified a large number of putative CREs (pCREs) in Arabidopsis thaliana with characteristics of authentic cis-elements. Surprisingly, biotic and abiotic responses are mostly mediated by two distinct pCRE superfamilies. In addition, we uncovered cis-regulatory codes specifying how pCRE presence and absence, combinatorial relationships, location, and copy number can be used to predict stress-responsive expression. Expression prediction models based on pCRE combinations perform significantly better than those based on simply pCRE presence and absence, location, and copy number. Furthermore, instead of a few master combinatorial rules for each stress condition, many rules were discovered, and each appears to control only a small subset of stress-responsive genes. Given there are very few documented interactions between plant CREs, the combinatorial rules we have uncovered significantly contribute to a better understanding of the cis-regulatory logic underlying plant stress response and provide prioritized targets for experimentation.",

abstract = "CRISPR screens are a powerful source of biological discovery, enabling the unbiased interrogation of gene function in a wide range of applications and species. In pooled CRISPR screens, various genetically encoded perturbations are introduced into pools of cells. The targeted cells proliferate under a biological challenge such as cell competition, drug treatment or viral infection. Subsequently, the perturbation-induced effects are evaluated by sequencing-based counting of the guide RNAs that specify each perturbation. The typical results of such screens are ranked lists of genes that confer sensitivity or resistance to the biological challenge of interest. Contributing to the broad utility of CRISPR screens, adaptations of the core CRISPR technology make it possible to activate, silence or otherwise manipulate the target genes. Moreover, high-content read-outs such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial imaging help characterize screened cells with unprecedented detail. Dedicated software tools facilitate bioinformatic analysis and enhance reproducibility. CRISPR screening has unravelled various molecular mechanisms in basic biology, medical genetics, cancer research, immunology, infectious diseases, microbiology and other fields. This Primer describes the basic and advanced concepts of CRISPR screening and its application as a flexible and reliable method for biological discovery, biomedical research and drug development --- with a special emphasis on high-content methods that make it possible to obtain detailed biological insights directly as part of the screen. CRISPR screening is a high-throughput approach for identifying genes, pathways and mechanisms involved in a given phenotype or biological process. High-content read-outs of these screens, such as imaging and single-cell sequencing techniques, have further broadened its applicability.

Here we introduce a series of entry clones and a destination vector for use in two, three, and four fragment Gateway MultiSite recombination cloning whose advantages include increased flexibility and versatility. In contrast to Gateway single-fragment cloning approaches where variations are typically incorporated into model system-specific destination vectors, our Gateway MultiSite cloning strategy incorporates variations in easily generated entry clones that are model system-independent. In particular, we present entry clones containing insertions of GAL4, QF, UAS, QUAS, eGFP, and mCherry, among others, and demonstrate their in vivo functionality in Drosophila by using them to generate expression clones including GAL4 and QF drivers for various trp ion channel family members, UAS and QUAS excitatory and inhibitory light-gated ion channels, and QUAS red and green fluorescent synaptic vesicle markers. We thus establish a starter toolkit of modular Gateway MultiSite entry clones potentially adaptable to any model system. An inventory of entry clones and destination vectors for Gateway MultiSite cloning has also been established (www.gatewaymultisite.org).",

However, experimental strategies for directed evolution are notoriously labor intensive and low throughput, limiting access to demanding functions, multiple functions in parallel, and the study of molecular evolution in replicate. We report OrthoRep, an orthogonal DNA polymerase-plasmid pair in yeast that stably mutates ∼100,000-fold faster than the host genome in vivo, exceeding the error threshold of genomic replication that causes single-generation extinction. User-defined genes in OrthoRep continuously and rapidly evolve through serial passaging, a highly straightforward and scalable process. Using OrthoRep, we evolved drug-resistant malarial dihydrofolate reductases (DHFRs) in 90 independent replicates. We uncovered a more complex fitness landscape than previously realized, including common adaptive trajectories constrained by epistasis, rare outcomes that avoid a frequent early adaptive mutation, and a suboptimal fitness peak that occasionally traps evolving populations. OrthoRep enables a new paradigm of routine, high-throughput evolution of biomolecular and cellular function.",

Following transfer, T-strands likely form complexes with Vir and plant proteins that traffic through the cytoplasm and enter the nucleus. T-strands may subsequently randomly integrate into plant chromosomes and permanently express encoded transgenes, a process known as stable transformation. The molecular processes by which T-strands integrate into the host genome remain unknown. Although integration resembles DNA repair processes, the requirement of known DNA repair pathways for integration is controversial. The configuration and genomic position of integrated T-DNA molecules likely affect transgene expression, and control of integration is consequently important for basic research and agricultural biotechnology applications. This article reviews our current knowledge of the process of T-DNA integration and proposes ways in which this knowledge may be manipulated for genome editing and synthetic biology purposes.",

Here, we designed a novel prime editor by fusing reverse transcriptase (RT) to nuclease wild-type Cas9 (WT-PE) to edit large genomic fragment. WT-PE system simultaneously introduced a double strand break (DSB) and a single 3' extended flap in the target site. Coupled with paired prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs) that have complementary sequences in their 3' terminus while target different genomic regions, WT-PE produced bi-directional prime editing, which enabled efficient and versatile large-scale genome editing, including large fragment deletion up to 16.8 megabase (Mb) pairs and chromosomal translocation.

abstract = "The CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas9 can be targeted to specific genomic loci by single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Here, we report the crystal structure of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 in complex with sgRNA and its target DNA at 2.5 {\AA} resolution. The structure revealed a bilobed architecture composed of target recognition and nuclease lobes, accommodating the sgRNA:DNA heteroduplex in a positively charged groove at their interface. Whereas the recognition lobe is essential for binding sgRNA and DNA, the nuclease lobe contains the HNH and RuvC nuclease domains, which are properly positioned for cleavage of the complementary and noncomplementary strands of the target DNA, respectively. The nuclease lobe also contains a carboxyl-terminal domain responsible for the interaction with the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). This high-resolution structure and accompanying functional analyses have revealed the molecular mechanism of RNA-guided DNA targeting by Cas9, thus paving the way for the rational design of new, versatile genome-editing technologies.",

However, some DNA sequences are refractory to CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage, which is at least in part due to gRNA misfolding. To overcome this problem, we have engineered gRNAs with highly stable hairpins in their constant parts and further enhanced their stability by chemical modifications. The 'Genome-editing Optimized Locked Design' (GOLD)-gRNA increases genome editing efficiency up to around 1000-fold (from 0.08 to 80.5\%) with a mean increase across different other targets of 7.4-fold. We anticipate that this improved gRNA will allow efficient editing regardless of spacer sequence composition and will be especially useful if a desired genomic site is difficult to edit.",

Not every gRNA elicits cleavage and the mechanisms that govern gRNA activity have not been resolved. Low activity could result from either failure to form a functional Cas9-gRNA complex or inability to recognize targets in vivo. Here we show that both phenomena influence Cas9 activity by comparing mutagenesis rates in zebrafish embryos with in vitro cleavage assays. In vivo, our results suggest that genomic factors such as CTCF inhibit mutagenesis. Comparing near-identical gRNA sequences with different in vitro activities reveals that internal gRNA interactions reduce cleavage. Even though gRNAs containing these structures do not yield cleavage-competent complexes, they can compete with active gRNAs for binding to Cas9. These results reveal that both genomic context and internal gRNA interactions can interfere with Cas9-mediated cleavage and illuminate previously uncharacterized features of Cas9-gRNA complex formation.",

In recent years, this system has been widely used for various gene editing applications. The CRISPR editing efficacy is mainly dependent on the single guide RNA (sgRNA), which guides Cas9 for genome cleavage. While there have been multiple attempts at improving sgRNA design, there is a pressing need for greater sgRNA potency and generalizability across various experimental conditions. RESULTS: We employed a unique plasmid library expressed in human cells to quantify the potency of thousands of CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNAs. Differential sequence and structural features among the most and least potent sgRNAs were then used to train a machine learning algorithm for assay design. Comparative analysis indicates that our new algorithm outperforms existing CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA design tools.

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Chromatin organizes DNA and regulates its transcriptional activity through epigenetic modifications. Heterochromatic regions of the genome are generally transcriptionally silent, while euchromatin is more prone to transcription. During DNA replication, both genetic information and chromatin modifications must be faithfully passed on to daughter strands. There is evidence that DNA polymerases play a role in transcriptional silencing, but the extent of their contribution and how it relates to heterochromatin maintenance is unclear. RESULTS: We isolate a strong hypomorphic Arabidopsis thaliana mutant of the POL2A catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon and show that POL2A is required to stabilize heterochromatin silencing genome-wide, likely by preventing replicative stress. We reveal that POL2A inhibits DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 9 methylation. Hence, the release of heterochromatin silencing in POL2A-deficient mutants paradoxically occurs in a chromatin context of increased levels of these two repressive epigenetic marks. At the nuclear level, the POL2A defect is associated with fragmentation of heterochromatin. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that POL2A is critical to heterochromatin structure and function, and that unhindered replisome progression is required for the faithful propagation of DNA methylation throughout the cell cycle.",

abstract = "Faithful DNA replication maintains genome stability in dividing cells and from one generation to the next. This is particularly important in plants because the whole plant body and reproductive cells originate from meristematic cells that retain their proliferative capacity throughout the life cycle of the organism. DNA replication involves large sets of proteins whose activity is strictly regulated, and is tightly linked to the DNA damage response to detect and respond to replication errors or defects. Central to this interconnection is the replicative polymerase DNA Polymerase ϵ (Pol ϵ) which participates in DNA replication per se, as well as replication stress response in animals and in yeast. Surprisingly, its function has to date been little explored in plants, and notably its relationship with DNA Damage Response (DDR) has not been investigated. Here, we have studied the role of the largest regulatory sub-unit of Arabidopsis DNA Pol ϵ: DPB2, using an over-expression strategy. We demonstrate that excess accumulation of the protein impairs DNA replication and causes endogenous DNA stress. Furthermore, we show that Pol ϵ dysfunction has contrasting outcomes in vegetative and reproductive cells and leads to the activation of distinct DDR pathways in the two cell types.",

abstract = "Accurate DNA replication is one of the most important events in the life of a cell. To perform this task, the cell utilizes several DNA polymerase complexes. We investigated the role of DNA polymerase epsilon during gametophyte and seed development using forward and reverse genetic approaches. In Arabidopsis, the catalytic subunit of this complex is encoded by two genes, AtPOL2a and AtPOL2b, whereas the second largest regulatory subunit AtDPB2 is present as a unique complete copy. Disruption of AtPOL2a or AtDPB2 resulted in a sporophytic embryo-defective phenotype, whilst mutations in AtPOL2b produced no visible effects. Loss of AtDPB2 function resulted in a severe reduction in nuclear divisions, both in the embryo and in the endosperm. Mutations in AtPOL2a allowed several rounds of mitosis to proceed, often with aberrant planes of division. Moreover, AtDPB2 was not expressed during development of the female gametophyte, which requires three post-meiotic nuclear divisions. Since a consensus binding site for E2F transcription factors was identified in the promoter region of both genes, the promoter-reporter fusion technique was used to show that luciferase activity was increased at specific phases of the cell cycle in synchronized tobacco BY-2 cells. Our results support the idea that fertilization may utilize the mechanisms of cell cycle transcriptional regulation of genes to reactivate the divisions of the oosphere and central cell.",

abstract = "The revolution in sequencing has created a wealth of plant genomes that can be mined to understand the evolution of biological complexity. Complexity is often driven by gene duplication, which allows paralogs to specialize in an activity of the ancestral gene or acquire novel functions. Angiosperms encode a variety of gene silencing pathways that share related machinery for small RNA biosynthesis and function. Recent phylogenetic analysis of these gene families plots the expansion, specialization, and occasional contraction of this core machinery. This analysis reveals the ancient origin of RNA-directed DNA Methylation in early land plants, or possibly their algal ancestors, as well as ongoing duplications that evolve novel small RNA pathways.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: In part due to the ease of visual detection of phenotypic changes, anthocyanin pigment production has long been the target of genetic and molecular research in plants. Specific members of the large family of plant myb transcription factors have been found to play critical roles in regulating expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and these genes continue to serve as important tools in dissecting the molecular mechanisms of plant gene regulation. FINDINGS: A spontaneous mutation within the coding region of an Arabidopsis 35S::AtMYB90 transgene converted the activator of plant-wide anthocyanin production to a dominant-negative allele (PG-1) that inhibits normal pigment production within tobacco petals. Sequence analysis identified a single base change that created a premature nonsense codon, truncating the encoded myb protein. The resulting mutant protein lacks 78 amino acids from the wild type C-terminus and was confirmed as the source of the white-flower phenotype. A putative tobacco homolog of AtMYB90 (NtAN2) was isolated and found to be expressed in flower petals but not leaves of all tobacco plants tested. Using transgenic tobacco constitutively expressing the NtAN2 gene confirmed the NtAN2 protein as the likely target of PG-1-based inhibition of tobacco pigment production. CONCLUSIONS: Messenger RNA and anthocyanin analysis of PG-1Sh transgenic lines (and PG-1Sh x purple 35S::NtAN2 seedlings) support a model in which the mutant myb transgene product acts as a competitive inhibitor of the native tobacco NtAN2 protein. This finding is important to researchers in the field of plant transcription factor analysis, representing a potential outcome for experiments analyzing in vivo protein function in test transgenic systems that over-express or mutate plant transcription factors.",

abstract = "Nicotiana benthamiana is employed around the world for many types of research and one transgenic line has been used more extensively than any other. This line, 16c, expresses the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP), highly and constitutively, and has been a major resource for visualising the mobility and actions of small RNAs. Insights into the mechanisms studied at a molecular level in N. benthamiana 16c are likely to be deeper and more accurate with a greater knowledge of the GFP gene integration site. Therefore, using next generation sequencing, genome mapping and local alignment, we identified the location and characteristics of the integrated T-DNA. As suggested from previous molecular hybridisation and inheritance data, the transgenic line contains a single GFP-expressing locus. However, the GFP coding sequence differs from that originally reported. Furthermore, a 3.2 kb portion of a transposon, appears to have co-integrated with the T-DNA. The location of the integration mapped to a region of the genome represented by Nbv0.5scaffold4905 in the www.benthgenome.com assembly, and with less integrity to Niben101Scf03641 in the www.solgenomics.net assembly. The transposon is not endogenous to laboratory strains of N. benthamiana or Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 (MP90), which was reportedly used in the generation of line 16c. However, it is present in the popular LBA4404 strain. The integrated transposon sequence includes its 5' terminal repeat and a transposase gene, and is immediately adjacent to the GFP gene. This unexpected genetic arrangement may contribute to the characteristics that have made the 16c line such a popular research tool and alerts researchers, taking transgenic plants to commercial release, to be aware of this genomic hitchhiker.",

Here we develop a versatile CRISPR-Combo platform, based on a single Cas9 protein, for simultaneous genome editing (targeted mutagenesis or base editing) and gene activation in plants. We showcase the powerful applications of CRISPR-Combo for boosting plant genome editing. First, CRISPR-Combo is used to shorten the plant life cycle and reduce the efforts in screening transgene-free genome-edited plants by activation of a florigen gene in Arabidopsis. Next, we demonstrate accelerated regeneration and propagation of genome-edited plants by activation of morphogenic genes in poplar. Furthermore, we apply CRISPR-Combo to achieve rice regeneration without exogenous plant hormones, which is established as a new method to predominately enrich heritable targeted mutations.

abstract = "Targeted genomic regulation is a powerful approach to accelerate trait discovery and development in agricultural biotechnology. Bacteria and archaea use clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) regulatory systems for adaptive molecular immunity against foreign nucleic acids introduced by invading phages and conjugative plasmids. The type II CRISPR/Cas system has been adapted for genome editing in many cell types and organisms. A recent study used the catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) protein combined with guide-RNAs (gRNAs) as a DNA-targeting platform to modulate gene expression in bacterial, yeast, and human cells. Here, we modified this DNA-targeting platform for targeted transcriptional regulation in planta by developing chimeric dCas9-based transcriptional activators and repressors. To generate transcriptional activators, we fused the dCas9 C-terminus with the activation domains of EDLL and TAL effectors. To generate a transcriptional repressor, we fused the dCas9 C-terminus with the SRDX repression domain. Our data demonstrate that dCas9 fusion with the EDLL activation domain (dCas9:EDLL) and the TAL activation domain (dCas9:TAD), guided by gRNAs complementary to selected promoter elements, induce strong transcriptional activation on Bs3::uidA targets in plant cells. Further, the dCas9:SRDX-mediated transcriptional repression of an endogenous gene. Thus, our results suggest that the synthetic transcriptional repressor (dCas9:SRDX) and activators (dCas9:EDLL and dCas9:TAD) can be used as endogenous transcription factors to repress or activate transcription of an endogenous genomic target. Our data indicate that the CRISPR/dCas9 DNA-targeting platform can be used in plants as a functional genomics tool and for biotechnological applications.",

Here, we investigate the structural roles of gRNAs in the CRISPR-Cas9 system by single-molecule spectroscopy and reveal a new conformation of inactive Cas9 that is thermodynamically more preferable than active apo-Cas9. We find that tracrRNA prevents Cas9 from changing into the inactive form and leads to the Cas9:gRNA complex. For the Cas9:gRNA complex, we identify sub-conformations of the RNA-DNA heteroduplex during R-loop expansion. Our single-molecule study indicates that the kinetics of the sub-conformations is controlled by the complementarity between crRNA and target DNA. We conclude that both tracrRNA and crRNA regulate the conformations and kinetics of the Cas9 complex, which are crucial in the DNA cleavage activity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system.",

abstract = "Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is the main repair pathway for DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in cells with limited 5' resection. To better understand how overhang polarity of chromosomal DSBs affects NHEJ, we made site-specific 5'-overhanging DSBs (5' DSBs) in yeast using an optimized zinc finger nuclease at an efficiency that approached HO-induced 3' DSB formation. When controlled for the extent of DSB formation, repair monitoring suggested that chromosomal 5' DSBs were rejoined more efficiently than 3' DSBs, consistent with a robust recruitment of NHEJ proteins to 5' DSBs. Ligation-mediated qPCR revealed that Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 rapidly modified 5' DSBs and facilitated protection of 3' DSBs, likely through recognition of overhang polarity by the Mre11 nuclease. Next-generation sequencing revealed that NHEJ at 5' DSBs had a higher mutation frequency, and validated the differential requirement of Pol4 polymerase at 3' and 5' DSBs. The end processing enzyme Tdp1 did not impact joining fidelity at chromosomal 5' DSBs as in previous plasmid studies, although Tdp1 was recruited to only 5' DSBs in a Ku-independent manner. These results suggest distinct DSB handling based on overhang polarity that impacts NHEJ kinetics and fidelity through differential recruitment and action of DSB modifying enzymes.",

To study mechanisms determining intragenomic mutation rate variability, we reanalyzed 43,483 de novo germline single base substitutions in 1,504 fast neutron irradiated mutation accumulation lines in Kitaake rice. Mutation rates were significantly lower in genomic regions marked by H3K4me1, a histone modification found in the gene bodies of actively expressed and evolutionarily conserved genes in plants. We observed conservation in rice for PDS5C, a cohesion cofactor involved in the homology-directed repair pathway that in A. thaliana binds to H3K4me1 via its Tudor domain and localizes to regions exhibiting reduced mutation rates: coding regions, essential genes, constitutively expressed genes, and genes under stronger purifying selection, mirroring mutation biases observed in rice as well. We find that Tudor domains are significantly enriched in DNA repair proteins (p<1e-11). These include the mismatch repair MSH6 protein, suggesting that plants have evolved multiple DNA repair pathways that target gene bodies and essential genes through H3K4me1 binding, which is supported by models of protein-peptide docking. These findings inspire further research to characterize mechanisms localizing DNA repair, potentially tuning the evolutionary trajectories of plant genomes. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

We also investigated XLF residues required for EJ without indels, finding that one of two binding domains is essential (L115 or C-terminal lysines that bind XRCC4 and KU/DNA, respectively), and that disruption of one of these domains sensitizes XLF to mutations that affect its dimer interface, which we examined with molecular dynamic simulations.

abstract = "Most insertions or deletions generated by CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) endonucleases are short (500 bp) can be observed. The possibility of generating long on-target DNA deletions poses safety risks to somatic genome editing and makes the outcomes of genome editing less predictable. Methods for generating refined mutations are desirable but currently unavailable. Here, we show that fusing Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I or the Klenow fragment to Cas9 greatly increases the frequencies of 1-bp deletions and decreases >1-bp deletions or insertions. Importantly, doing so also greatly decreases the generation of long deletions, including those >2 kb. In addition, templated insertions (the insertion of the nucleotide 4 nt upstream of the protospacer adjacent motif) were increased relative to other insertions. Counteracting DNA resection was one of the mechanisms perturbing deletion sizes. Targeting DNA polymerase to double-strand breaks did not increase off-targets or base substitution rates around the cleavage sites, yet increased editing efficiency in primary cells. Our strategy makes it possible to generate refined DNA mutations for improved safety without sacrificing efficiency of genome editing.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Many applications of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing require Cas9-induced non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which was thought to be error prone. However, with directly ligatable ends, Cas9-induced DNA double strand breaks may be repaired preferentially by accurate NHEJ. RESULTS: In the repair of two adjacent double strand breaks induced by paired Cas9-gRNAs at 71 genome sites, accurate NHEJ accounts for about 50\% of NHEJ events. This paired Cas9-gRNA approach underestimates the level of accurate NHEJ due to frequent + 1 templated insertions, which can be avoided by the predefined Watson/Crick orientation of protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs). The paired Cas9-gRNA strategy also provides a flexible, reporter-less approach for analyzing both accurate and mutagenic NHEJ in cells and in vivo, and it has been validated in cells deficient for XRCC4 and in mouse liver. Due to high frequencies of precise deletions of defined ``3n''-, ``3n + 1''-, or ``3n + 2''-bp length, accurate NHEJ is used to improve the efficiency and homogeneity of gene knockouts and targeted in-frame deletions. Compared to ``3n + 1''-bp, ``3n + 2''-bp can overcome + 1 templated insertions to increase the frequency of out-of-frame mutations. By applying paired Cas9-gRNAs to edit MDC1 and key 53BP1 domains, we are able to generate predicted, precise deletions for functional analysis. Lastly, a Plk3 inhibitor promotes NHEJ with bias towards accurate NHEJ, providing a chemical approach to improve genome editing requiring precise deletions. CONCLUSIONS: NHEJ is inherently accurate in repair of Cas9-induced DNA double strand breaks and can be harnessed to improve CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing requiring precise deletion of a defined length.",

However, the ability to control these outcomes remains limited, especially for 1-bp insertions, a common and therapeutically relevant class of repair outcomes. Here, through a small molecule screen, we identify the ATM kinase inhibitor KU-60019 as a compound capable of reproducibly increasing the fraction of 1-bp insertions relative to other Cas9 repair outcomes. Small molecule or genetic ATM inhibition increases 1-bp insertion outcome fraction across three human and mouse cell lines, two Cas9 species, and dozens of target sites, although concomitantly reducing the fraction of edited alleles. Notably, KU-60019 increases the relative frequency of 1-bp insertions to over 80\% of edited alleles at several native human genomic loci and improves the efficiency of correction for pathogenic 1-bp deletion variants. The ability to increase 1-bp insertion frequency adds another dimension to precise template-free Cas9-nuclease genome editing.",

abstract = "Many bacterial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems employ the dual RNA-guided DNA endonuclease Cas9 to defend against invading phages and conjugative plasmids by introducing site-specific double-stranded breaks in target DNA. Target recognition strictly requires the presence of a short protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) flanking the target site, and subsequent R-loop formation and strand scission are driven by complementary base pairing between the guide RNA and target DNA, Cas9-DNA interactions, and associated conformational changes. The use of CRISPR-Cas9 as an RNA-programmable DNA targeting and editing platform is simplified by a synthetic single-guide RNA (sgRNA) mimicking the natural dual trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA)-CRISPR RNA (crRNA) structure. This review aims to provide an in-depth mechanistic and structural understanding of Cas9-mediated RNA-guided DNA targeting and cleavage. Molecular insights from biochemical and structural studies provide a framework for rational engineering aimed at altering catalytic function, guide RNA specificity, and PAM requirements and reducing off-target activity for the development of Cas9-based therapies against genetic diseases.",

Here we describe prime editing, a versatile and precise genome editing method that directly writes new genetic information into a specified DNA site using a catalytically impaired Cas9 endonuclease fused to an engineered reverse transcriptase, programmed with a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) that both specifies the target site and encodes the desired edit. We performed more than 175 edits in human cells, including targeted insertions, deletions, and all 12 types of point mutation, without requiring double-strand breaks or donor DNA templates. We used prime editing in human cells to correct, efficiently and with few byproducts, the primary genetic causes of sickle cell disease (requiring a transversion in HBB) and Tay-Sachs disease (requiring a deletion in HEXA); to install a protective transversion in PRNP; and to insert various tags and epitopes precisely into target loci. Four human cell lines and primary post-mitotic mouse cortical neurons support prime editing with varying efficiencies. Prime editing shows higher or similar efficiency and fewer byproducts than homology-directed repair, has complementary strengths and weaknesses compared to base editing, and induces much lower off-target editing than Cas9 nuclease at known Cas9 off-target sites. Prime editing substantially expands the scope and capabilities of genome editing, and in principle could correct up to 89\% of known genetic variants associated with human diseases.",

In some cases, these bacterial nucleases have demonstrated off-target activity. This creates a potential hazard for therapeutic applications and could confound results in biological research. Therefore, improving the precision of these nucleases is of broad interest. Here we show that engineering a hairpin secondary structure onto the spacer region of single guide RNAs (hp-sgRNAs) can increase specificity by several orders of magnitude when combined with various CRISPR effectors. We first demonstrate that designed hp-sgRNAs can tune the activity of a transactivator based on Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9). We then show that hp-sgRNAs increase the specificity of gene editing using five different Cas9 or Cas12a variants. Our results demonstrate that RNA secondary structure is a fundamental parameter that can tune the activity of diverse CRISPR systems.",

In the present study, we describe a prime editing-based method, PRIME-Del, which induces a deletion using a pair of prime editing sgRNAs (pegRNAs) that target opposite DNA strands, programming not only the sites that are nicked but also the outcome of the repair. PRIME-Del achieves markedly higher precision than CRISPR-Cas9 and sgRNA pairs in programming deletions up to 10 kb, with 1-30\% editing efficiency. PRIME-Del can also be used to couple genomic deletions with short insertions, enabling deletions with junctions that do not fall at protospacer-adjacent motif sites. Finally, extended expression of prime editing components can substantially enhance efficiency without compromising precision. We anticipate that PRIME-Del will be broadly useful for precise, flexible programming of genomic deletions, epitope tagging and, potentially, programming genomic rearrangements.",

Here, we describe a set of resources to streamline reporter gene knock-ins in zebrafish and demonstrate the broader utility of the method in mammalian cells. Our approach uses short homology of 24-48 bp to drive targeted integration of DNA reporter cassettes by homology-mediated end joining (HMEJ) at high frequency at a double strand break in the targeted gene. Our vector series, pGTag (plasmids for Gene Tagging), contains reporters flanked by a universal CRISPR sgRNA sequence which enables in vivo liberation of the homology arms. We observed high rates of germline transmission (22-100\%) for targeted knock-ins at eight zebrafish loci and efficient integration at safe harbor loci in porcine and human cells. Our system provides a straightforward and cost-effective approach for high efficiency gene targeting applications in CRISPR and TALEN compatible systems.",

abstract = "Improved methods for engineering sequence-specific nucleases, including zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and TAL effector nucleases (TALENs), have made it possible to precisely modify plant genomes. However, the success of genome modification is largely dependent on the intrinsic activity of the engineered nucleases. In this study, we sought to enhance ZFN-mediated targeted mutagenesis and gene targeting (GT) in Arabidopsis by manipulating DNA repair pathways. Using a ZFN that creates a double-strand break (DSB) at the endogenous ADH1 locus, we analyzed repair outcomes in the absence of DNA repair proteins such as KU70 and LIG4 (both involved in classic nonhomologous end-joining, NHEJ) and SMC6B (involved in sister-chromatid-based homologous recombination, HR). We achieved a fivefold to 16-fold enhancement in HR-based GT in a ku70 mutant and a threefold to fourfold enhancement in GT in the lig4 mutant. Although the NHEJ mutagenesis frequency was not significantly changed in ku70 or lig4, DNA repair was shifted to microhomology-dependent alternative NHEJ. As a result, mutations in both ku70 and lig4 were predominantly large deletions, which facilitates easy screening for mutations by PCR. Interestingly, NHEJ mutagenesis and GT at the ADH1 locus were enhanced by sixfold to eightfold and threefold to fourfold, respectively, in a smc6b mutant. The increase in NHEJ-mediated mutagenesis by loss of SMC6B was further confirmed using ZFNs that target two other Arabidopsis genes, namely, TT4 and MPK8. Considering that components of DNA repair pathways are highly conserved across species, mutations in DNA repair genes likely provide a universal strategy for harnessing repair pathways to achieve desired targeted genome modifications.",

Here we describe a detailed GUIDE-seq protocol including cell transfection, library preparation, sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. The entire protocol including cell culture can be completed in 9 d. Once tag-integrated genomic DNA is isolated, library preparation, sequencing and analysis can be performed in 3 d.

abstract = "Bacterial blight of rice is an important disease in Asia and Africa. The pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), secretes one or more of six known transcription-activator-like effectors (TALes) that bind specific promoter sequences and induce, at minimum, one of the three host sucrose transporter genes SWEET11, SWEET13 and SWEET14, the expression of which is required for disease susceptibility. We used CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing to introduce mutations in all three SWEET gene promoters. Editing was further informed by sequence analyses of TALe genes in 63 Xoo strains, which revealed multiple TALe variants for SWEET13 alleles. Mutations were also created in SWEET14, which is also targeted by two TALes from an African Xoo lineage. A total of five promoter mutations were simultaneously introduced into the rice line Kitaake and the elite mega varieties IR64 and Ciherang-Sub1. Paddy trials showed that genome-edited SWEET promoters endow rice lines with robust, broad-spectrum resistance.",

abstract = "The majority of plant disease resistance (R) genes encode proteins that share common structural features. However, the transcription activator-like effector (TALE)-associated executor type R genes show no considerable sequence homology to any known R genes. We adopted a map-based cloning approach and TALE-based technology to isolate and characterize Xa23, a new executor R gene derived from wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) that confers an extremely broad spectrum of resistance to bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Xa23 encodes a 113 amino acid protein that shares 50\% identity with the known executor R protein XA10. The predicted transmembrane helices in XA23 also overlap with those of XA10. Unlike Xa10, however, Xa23 transcription is specifically activated by AvrXa23, a TALE present in all examined Xoo field isolates. Moreover, the susceptible xa23 allele has an identical open reading frame of Xa23 but differs in promoter region by lacking the TALE binding element (EBE) for AvrXa23. XA23 can trigger a strong hypersensitive response in rice, tobacco, and tomato. Our results provide the first evidence that plant genomes have an executor R gene family of which members execute their function and spectrum of disease resistance by recognizing the cognate TALEs in the pathogen.",

abstract = "The rice (Oryza sativa) gene xa13 is a recessive resistance allele of Os-8N3, a member of the NODULIN3 (N3) gene family, located on rice chromosome 8. Os-8N3 is a susceptibility (S) gene for Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae, the causal agent of bacterial blight, and the recessive allele is defeated by strains of the pathogen producing any one of the type III effectors AvrXa7, PthXo2, or PthXo3, which are all members of the transcription activator-like (TAL) effector family. Both AvrXa7 and PthXo3 induce the expression of a second member of the N3 gene family, here named Os-11N3. Insertional mutagenesis or RNA-mediated silencing of Os-11N3 resulted in plants with loss of susceptibility specifically to strains of X. oryzae pv oryzae dependent on AvrXa7 or PthXo3 for virulence. We further show that AvrXa7 drives expression of Os-11N3 and that AvrXa7 interacts and binds specifically to an effector binding element within the Os-11N3 promoter, lending support to the predictive models for TAL effector binding specificity. The result indicates that variations in the TAL effector repetitive domains are driven by selection to overcome both dominant and recessive forms of resistance to bacterial blight in rice. The finding that Os-8N3 and Os-11N3 encode closely related proteins also provides evidence that N3 proteins have a specific function in facilitating bacterial blight disease.",

Arabidopsis SWEET8 is essential for pollen viability, and the rice homologues SWEET11 and SWEET14 are specifically exploited by bacterial pathogens for virulence by means of direct binding of a bacterial effector to the SWEET promoter. Bacterial symbionts and fungal and bacterial pathogens induce the expression of different SWEET genes, indicating that the sugar efflux function of SWEET transporters is probably targeted by pathogens and symbionts for nutritional gain.

abstract = "The efficient repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in genomic DNA is important for the survival of all organisms. In recent years, basic mechanisms of DSB repair in somatic plant cells have been elucidated. DSBs are mainly repaired by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). The repair can be associated with deletions, but also insertions due to copying genomic sequences from elsewhere into the break. Species-specific differences of NHEJ have been reported and an inverse correlation of deletion size to genome size has been postulated, indicating that NHEJ might contribute significantly to evolution of genome size. DSB repair by homologous recombination (HR) might also influence genome organization. Whereas homology present in an allelic or an ectopic position is hardly used for repair, the use of homologous sequences in close proximity to the break is frequent. A 'single-strand annealing' mechanism that leads to sequence deletions between direct repeats is particularly efficient. This might explain the accumulation of single long terminal repeats of retroelements in cereal genomes. The conservative 'synthesis-dependent strand annealing' mechanism, resulting in conversions without crossovers is also prominent and seems to be significant for the evolution of tandemly arranged gene families such as resistance genes. Induction of DSBs could be used as a means for the controlled manipulation of plant genomes in an analogous way for the use of marker gene excision and site-specific integration.",

Here, we show that expression of a fusion protein combining wheat GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 4 (GRF4) and its cofactor GRF-INTERACTING FACTOR 1 (GIF1) substantially increases the efficiency and speed of regeneration in wheat, triticale and rice and increases the number of transformable wheat genotypes. GRF4--GIF1 transgenic plants were fertile and without obvious developmental defects. Moreover, GRF4--GIF1 induced efficient wheat regeneration in the absence of exogenous cytokinins, which facilitates selection of transgenic plants without selectable markers. We also combined GRF4--GIF1 with CRISPR--Cas9 genome editing and generated 30 edited wheat plants with disruptions in the gene Q (AP2L-A5). Finally, we show that a dicot GRF--GIF chimera improves regeneration efficiency in citrus, suggesting that this strategy can be applied to dicot crops.

abstract = "BACKGROUND: The use of homologous recombination to precisely modify plant genomes has been challenging, due to the lack of efficient methods for delivering DNA repair templates to plant cells. Even with the advent of sequence-specific nucleases, which stimulate homologous recombination at predefined genomic sites by creating targeted DNA double-strand breaks, there are only a handful of studies that report precise editing of endogenous genes in crop plants. More efficient methods are needed to modify plant genomes through homologous recombination, ideally without randomly integrating foreign DNA. RESULTS: Here, we use geminivirus replicons to create heritable modifications to the tomato genome at frequencies tenfold higher than traditional methods of DNA delivery (i.e., Agrobacterium). A strong promoter was inserted upstream of a gene controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis, resulting in overexpression and ectopic accumulation of pigments in tomato tissues. More than two-thirds of the insertions were precise, and had no unanticipated sequence modifications. Both TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 achieved gene targeting at similar efficiencies. Further, the targeted modification was transmitted to progeny in a Mendelian fashion. Even though donor molecules were replicated in the vectors, no evidence was found of persistent extra-chromosomal replicons or off-target integration of T-DNA or replicon sequences. CONCLUSIONS: High-frequency, precise modification of the tomato genome was achieved using geminivirus replicons, suggesting that these vectors can overcome the efficiency barrier that has made gene targeting in plants challenging. This work provides a foundation for efficient genome editing of crop genomes without the random integration of foreign DNA.",

abstract = "We report a comprehensive toolkit that enables targeted, specific modification of monocot and dicot genomes using a variety of genome engineering approaches. Our reagents, based on transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system, are systematized for fast, modular cloning and accommodate diverse regulatory sequences to drive reagent expression. Vectors are optimized to create either single or multiple gene knockouts and large chromosomal deletions. Moreover, integration of geminivirus-based vectors enables precise gene editing through homologous recombination. Regulation of transcription is also possible. A Web-based tool streamlines vector selection and construction. One advantage of our platform is the use of the Csy-type (CRISPR system yersinia) ribonuclease 4 (Csy4) and tRNA processing enzymes to simultaneously express multiple guide RNAs (gRNAs). For example, we demonstrate targeted deletions in up to six genes by expressing 12 gRNAs from a single transcript. Csy4 and tRNA expression systems are almost twice as effective in inducing mutations as gRNAs expressed from individual RNA polymerase III promoters. Mutagenesis can be further enhanced 2.5-fold by incorporating the Trex2 exonuclease. Finally, we demonstrate that Cas9 nickases induce gene targeting at frequencies comparable to native Cas9 when they are delivered on geminivirus replicons. The reagents have been successfully validated in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), Medicago truncatula, wheat (Triticum aestivum), and barley (Hordeum vulgare).",

Moreover, by bypassing confounding effects from guide RNA sequence, mgRNAs unveiled that Cas9 binding is enhanced at chromatin-accessible regions, and cleavage by bound Cas9 is more efficient near transcribed regions. Combined with light-mediated activation and deactivation of Cas9 activity, mgRNAs further enabled high-throughput study of the cellular response to double-strand breaks with high temporal resolution, revealing the presence, extent (under 2 kb) and kinetics (~1 h) of reversible DNA damage-induced chromatin decompaction. Altogether, this work establishes mgRNAs as a generalizable platform for multiplexing CRISPR and advances our understanding of intracellular Cas9 activity and the DNA damage response at endogenous loci.",

To determine the genetic basis of SSTR in human cells, we developed a coupled inhibition-cutting system capable of interrogating multiple editing outcomes in the context of thousands of individual gene knockdowns. We found that human Cas9-induced SSTR requires the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, which is normally implicated in interstrand cross-link repair. The FA pathway does not directly impact error-prone, non-homologous end joining, but instead diverts repair toward SSTR. Furthermore, FANCD2 protein localizes to Cas9-induced DSBs, indicating a direct role in regulating genome editing. Since FA is itself a genetic disease, these data imply that patient genotype and/or transcriptome may impact the effectiveness of gene editing treatments and that treatments biased toward FA repair pathways could have therapeutic value. A coupled knockdown-editing screen shows that CRISPR--Cas9 editing in human cells requires the Fanconi anemia pathway, which acts by diverting double-strand break repair away from non-homologous end joining toward single-strand template repair.",

Here we investigate the interaction of Cas9 with target DNA and use our findings to improve HDR efficiency. We show that dissociation of Cas9 from double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) substrates is slow (lifetime ∼6 h) but that, before complete dissociation, Cas9 asymmetrically releases the 3' end of the cleaved DNA strand that is not complementary to the sgRNA (nontarget strand). By rationally designing single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) donors of the optimal length complementary to the strand that is released first, we increase the rate of HDR in human cells when using Cas9 or nickase variants to up to 60\%. We also demonstrate HDR rates of up to 0.7\% using a catalytically inactive Cas9 mutant (dCas9), which binds DNA without cleaving it.",

abstract = "Plant biotechnology predominantly relies on a restricted set of genetic parts with limited capability to customize spatiotemporal and conditional expression patterns. Synthetic gene circuits have the potential to integrate multiple customizable input signals through a processing unit constructed from biological parts to produce a predictable and programmable output. Here we present a suite of functional recombinase-based gene circuits for use in plants. We first established a range of key gene circuit components compatible with plant cell functionality. We then used these to develop a range of operational logic gates using the identify function (activation) and negation function (repression) in Arabidopsis protoplasts and in vivo, demonstrating their utility for programmable manipulation of transcriptional activity in a complex multicellular organism. Specifically, using recombinases and plant control elements, we activated transgenes in YES, OR and AND gates and repressed them in NOT, NOR and NAND gates; we also implemented the A NIMPLY B gate that combines activation and repression. Through use of genetic recombination, these circuits create stable long-term changes in expression and recording of past stimuli. This highly compact programmable gene circuit platform provides new capabilities for engineering sophisticated transcriptional programs and previously unrealized traits into plants.",

In Arabidopsis, 18 HDAC genes are divided into three different types - RPD3-like, HD-tuin and sirtuin - with two or more members in each type. The structural feature of each HDAC class, the expression profile of each HDAC gene during development and functional insights of important family members are summarized here.

abstract = "Plants are inescapably exposed to environmental stress because of their sessile lifestyle. Such stress induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are in turn a source of genotoxic stress. ROS are also generated intrinsically during photosynthesis in the chloroplasts. Furthermore, plants are affected by the UV component of sunlight, which damages their genomes. To protect their genomic integrity from DNA damage, plants activate a DNA damage response (DDR) system that regulates cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and programmed cell death. Although plants have orthologs of several of the DDR factors that are found in animals, certain critical animal DDR factors, notably the tumor suppressor p53 and the DDR kinases CHK1 and CHK2, have not been found in plants. In this mini-review, we summarize the functions and regulatory mechanism of Arabidopsis thaliana SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE 1 (SOG1), a plant-specific transcription factor that plays a central role in the DDR. The characteristics of SOG1 are similar to those of animal p53, even though the proteins' amino acid sequences are unrelated. We suggest that plants acquired the central transcriptional factor SOG1 as a functional homolog of p53 during the evolution of their DDR system.",

These stem cell populations remain active throughout the plant's life, which can last for centuries, and are particularly exposed to environmental hazards that cause DNA damage and mutations. It is not known whether plants have mechanisms to safeguard the genome specifically in these crucial cell populations. Here, we show that root and shoot stem cells and their early descendants are selectively killed by mild treatment with radiomimetic drugs, x-rays, or mutations that disrupt DNA repair by nonhomologous end-joining. Stem cell death required transduction of DNA damage signals by the ATAXIA-TELANGIECTASIA MUTATED (ATM) kinase and, specifically in the root, also the ATM/RAD3-RELATED (ATR) kinase. Consistent with the absence of p53 and the core apoptotic machinery in plants, death of the stem cells did not show apoptotic but autolytic features as seen in other cases of plant developmentally programmed cell death. We propose that plants have independently evolved selective death as a stringent mechanism to safeguard genome integrity in their stem cell populations.",

abstract = "DNA polymerase lambda (Pol lambda) is one of several DNA polymerases suggested to participate in base excision repair (BER), in repair of broken DNA ends and in translesion synthesis. It has been proposed that the nature of the DNA intermediates partly determines which polymerase is used for a particular repair reaction. To test this hypothesis, here we examine the ability of human Pol lambda to extend mismatched primer-termini, either on 'open' template-primer substrates, or on its preferred substrate, a 1 nt gapped-DNA molecule having a 5'-phosphate. Interestingly, Pol lambda extended mismatches with an average efficiency of approximately 10(-2) relative to matched base pairs. The match and mismatch extension catalytic efficiencies obtained on gapped molecules were approximately 260-fold higher than on template-primer molecules. A crystal structure of Pol lambda in complex with a single-nucleotide gap containing a dG.dGMP mismatch at the primer-terminus (2.40 A) suggests that, at least for certain mispairs, Pol lambda is unable to differentiate between matched and mismatched termini during the DNA binding step, thus accounting for the relatively high efficiency of mismatch extension. This property of Pol lambda suggests a potential role as a 'mismatch extender' during non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and possibly during translesion synthesis.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Evolution of DNA polymerases, the key enzymes of DNA replication and repair, is central to any reconstruction of the history of cellular life. However, the details of the evolutionary relationships between DNA polymerases of archaea and eukaryotes remain unresolved. RESULTS: We performed a comparative analysis of archaeal, eukaryotic, and bacterial B-family DNA polymerases, which are the main replicative polymerases in archaea and eukaryotes, combined with an analysis of domain architectures. Surprisingly, we found that eukaryotic Polymerase epsilon consists of two tandem exonuclease-polymerase modules, the active N-terminal module and a C-terminal module in which both enzymatic domains are inactivated. The two modules are only distantly related to each other, an observation that suggests the possibility that Pol epsilon evolved as a result of insertion and subsequent inactivation of a distinct polymerase, possibly, of bacterial descent, upstream of the C-terminal Zn-fingers, rather than by tandem duplication. The presence of an inactivated exonuclease-polymerase module in Pol epsilon parallels a similar inactivation of both enzymatic domains in a distinct family of archaeal B-family polymerases. The results of phylogenetic analysis indicate that eukaryotic B-family polymerases, most likely, originate from two distantly related archaeal B-family polymerases, one form giving rise to Pol epsilon, and the other one to the common ancestor of Pol alpha, Pol delta, and Pol zeta. The C-terminal Zn-fingers that are present in all eukaryotic B-family polymerases, unexpectedly, are homologous to the Zn-finger of archaeal D-family DNA polymerases that are otherwise unrelated to the B family. The Zn-finger of Polepsilon shows a markedly greater similarity to the counterpart in archaeal PolD than the Zn-fingers of other eukaryotic B-family polymerases. CONCLUSION: Evolution of eukaryotic DNA polymerases seems to have involved previously unnoticed complex events. We hypothesize that the archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes encoded three DNA polymerases, namely, two distinct B-family polymerases and a D-family polymerase all of which contributed to the evolution of the eukaryotic replication machinery. The Zn-finger might have been acquired from PolD by the B-family form that gave rise to Pol epsilon prior to or in the course of eukaryogenesis, and subsequently, was captured by the ancestor of the other B-family eukaryotic polymerases. The inactivated polymerase-exonuclease module of Pol epsilon might have evolved by fusion with a distinct polymerase, rather than by duplication of the active module of Pol epsilon, and is likely to play an important role in the assembly of eukaryotic replication and repair complexes.",

abstract = "Mutation is the ultimate genetic source of evolution and biodiversity, but to what extent the environment impacts mutation rate and spectrum is poorly understood. Past studies discovered mutagenesis induced by antibiotic treatment or starvation, but its relevance and importance to long-term evolution is unclear because these severe stressors typically halt cell growth and/or cause substantial cell deaths. Here, we quantify the mutation rate and spectrum in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by whole-genome sequencing following mutation accumulation in each of seven environments with relatively rapid cell growths and minimal cell deaths. We find the point mutation rate per generation to differ by 3.6-fold among the seven environments, generally increasing in environments with slower cell growths. This trend renders the mutation rate per year more constant than that per generation across environments, which has implications for neutral evolution and the molecular clock. Additionally, we find substantial among-environment variations in mutation spectrum, such as the transition to transversion ratio and AT mutational bias. Other main mutation types, including small insertion or deletion, segmental duplication or deletion, and chromosome gain or loss also tend to occur more frequently in environments where yeast grows more slowly. In contrast to these findings from the nuclear genome, the yeast mitochondrial mutation rate rises with the growth rate, consistent with the metabolic rate hypothesis. Together, these observations indicate that environmental changes, which are ubiquitous in nature, influence not only natural selection, but also the amount and type of mutations available to selection, and suggest that ignoring the latter impact, as is currently practiced, may mislead evolutionary inferences.",

abstract = "In their life cycle, plants are exposed to various unfavorable environmental factors including ultraviolet (UV) radiation emitted by the Sun. UV-A and UV-B, which are partially absorbed by the ozone layer, reach the surface of the Earth causing harmful effects among the others on plant genetic material. The energy of UV light is sufficient to induce mutations in DNA. Some examples of DNA damage induced by UV are pyrimidine dimers, oxidized nucleotides as well as single and double-strand breaks. When exposed to light, plants can repair major UV-induced DNA lesions, i.e., pyrimidine dimers using photoreactivation. However, this highly efficient light-dependent DNA repair system is ineffective in dim light or at night. Moreover, it is helpless when it comes to the repair of DNA lesions other than pyrimidine dimers. In this review, we have focused on how plants cope with deleterious DNA damage that cannot be repaired by photoreactivation. The current understanding of light-independent mechanisms, classified as dark DNA repair, indispensable for the maintenance of plant genetic material integrity has been presented.",

abstract = "Gene regulation via chemically induced dimerization (CID) is useful for biomedical research. However, the number, type, versatility, and in vivo applications of CID tools remain limited. Here, we demonstrate the development of proteolysis-targeting chimera-based scalable CID (PROTAC-CID) platforms by systematically engineering the available PROTAC systems for inducible gene regulation and gene editing. Further, we show orthogonal PROTAC-CIDs that can fine-tune gene expression at gradient levels or multiplex biological signals with different logic gating operations. Coupling the PROTAC-CID platform with genetic circuits, we achieve digitally inducible expression of DNA recombinases, base- and prime-editors for transient genome manipulation. Finally, we package a compact PROTAC-CID system into adeno-associated viral vectors for inducible and reversible gene activation in vivo.

abstract = "The DNA double-strand break (DSB) is a critical type of damage, and can be induced by both endogenous sources (e.g., errors of oxidative metabolism, transposable elements, programmed meiotic breaks, or perturbation of the DNA replication fork) and exogenous sources (e.g., ionizing radiation or radiomimetic chemicals). Although higher plants, like mammals, are thought to preferentially repair DSBs via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), much remains unclear about plant DSB repair pathways. Our reverse genetic approach suggests that DNA polymerase $\lambda$ is involved in DSB repair in Arabidopsis. The Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant (atpol$\lambda$-1) displayed sensitivity to both gamma-irradiation and treatment with radiomimetic reagents, but not to other DNA damaging treatments. The atpol$\lambda$-1 mutant showed a moderate sensitivity to DSBs, while Arabidopsis Ku70 and DNA ligase 4 mutants (atku70-3 and atlig4-2), both of which play critical roles in NHEJ, exhibited a hypersensitivity to these treatments. The atpol$\lambda$-1/atlig4-2 double mutant exhibited a higher sensitivity to DSBs than each single mutant, but the atku70/atpol$\lambda$-1 showed similar sensitivity to the atku70-3 mutant. We showed that transcription of the DNA ligase 1, DNA ligase 6, and Wee1 genes was quickly induced by BLM in several NHEJ deficient mutants in contrast to wild-type. Finally, the T-DNA transformation efficiency dropped in NHEJ deficient mutants and the lowest transformation efficiency was scored in the atpol$\lambda$-1/atlig4-2 double mutant. These results imply that AtPol$\lambda$ is involved in both DSB repair and DNA damage response pathway.",

abstract = "The nonhomologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ) pathway is a key mechanism for repairing dsDNA breaks that occur often in eukaryotic cells. In the simplest model, these breaks are first recognized by Ku, which then interacts with other NHEJ proteins to improve their affinity at DNA ends. These include DNA-PKcs and Artemis for trimming the DNA ends; DNA polymerase $\mu$ and $\lambda$ to add nucleotides; and the DNA ligase IV complex to ligate the ends with the additional factors, XRCC4 (X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 4), XLF (XRCC4-like factor/Cernunos), and PAXX (paralog of XRCC4 and XLF). In vivo studies have demonstrated the degrees of importance of these NHEJ proteins in the mechanism of repair of dsDNA breaks, but interpretations can be confounded by other cellular processes. In vitro studies with NHEJ proteins have been performed to evaluate the nucleolytic resection, polymerization, and ligation steps, but a complete system has been elusive. Here we have developed a NHEJ reconstitution system that includes the nuclease, polymerase, and ligase components to evaluate relative NHEJ efficiency and analyze ligated junctional sequences for various types of DNA ends, including blunt, 5' overhangs, and 3' overhangs. We find that different dsDNA end structures have differential dependence on these enzymatic components. The dependence of some end joining on only Ku and XRCC4·DNA ligase IV allows us to formulate a physical model that incorporates nuclease and polymerase components as needed.",

abstract = "Endogenously-arising DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) rarely harbor canonical 5'-phosphate, 3'-hydroxyl moieties at the ends, which are, regardless of the pathway used, ultimately required for their repair. Cells are therefore endowed with a wide variety of enzymes that can deal with these chemical and structural variations and guarantee the formation of ligatable termini. An important distinction is whether the ends are directly ``unblocked'' by specific enzymatic activities without affecting the integrity of the DNA molecule and its sequence, or whether they are ``processed'' by unspecific nucleases that remove nucleotides from the termini. DNA end structure and configuration, therefore, shape the repair process, its requirements, and, importantly, its final outcome. Thus, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate and integrate the cellular response to blocked DSBs, although still largely unexplored, can be particularly relevant for maintaining genome integrity and avoiding malignant transformation and cancer.",

We show here that this flexibility is often reliant on the ability to direct DNA synthesis across strand breaks, and that polymerase (Pol) $\mu$ and Pol $\lambda$ are the only mammalian DNA polymerases that have this activity. By systematically varying substrate in cells, we show each polymerase is uniquely proficient in different contexts. The templating nucleotide is also selected differently, with Pol $\mu$ using the unpaired base adjacent to the downstream 5' phosphate even when there are available template sites further upstream of this position; this makes Pol $\mu$ more flexible but also less accurate than Pol $\lambda$. Loss of either polymerase alone consequently has clear and distinguishable effects on the fidelity of repair, but end remodeling by cellular nucleases and the remaining polymerase helps mitigate the effects on overall repair efficiency. Accordingly, when cells are deficient in both polymerases there is synergistic impact on NHEJ efficiency, both in terms of repair of defined substrates and cellular resistance to ionizing radiation. Pol $\mu$ and Pol $\lambda$ thus provide distinct solutions to a problem for DNA synthesis that is unique to this pathway and play a key role in conferring on NHEJ the flexibility required for accurate and efficient repair.",

We sought to address this question by analysing cellular NHEJ of ends with systematically mispaired and damaged termini. We show NHEJ is uniquely proficient at bypassing subtle terminal mispairs and radiomimetic damage by direct ligation. Nevertheless, bypass ability varies widely, with increases in mispair severity gradually reducing bypass products from 85 to 6\%. End-processing by nucleases and polymerases is increased to compensate, although paths with the fewest number of steps to generate a substrate suitable for ligation are favoured. Thus, both the frequency and nature of end processing are tailored to meet the needs of the ligation step. We propose a model where the ligase organizes all steps during NHEJ within the stable paired-end complex to limit end processing and associated errors.",

BER has been extensively studied in microbial and animal systems, but knowledge in plants has lagged behind until recently. Results obtained so far indicate that plants share many BER factors with other organisms, but also possess some unique features and combinations. Plant BER plays an important role in preserving genome integrity through removal of damaged bases. However, it performs additional important functions, such as the replacement of the naturally modified base 5-methylcytosine with cytosine in a plant-specific pathway for active DNA demethylation.",

abstract = "Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) suppresses cassava yields across the tropics. The dominant CMD2 locus confers resistance to cassava mosaic geminiviruses. It has been reported that CMD2-type landraces lose resistance after regeneration through de novo morphogenesis. As full genome bisulfite sequencing failed to uncover an epigenetic mechanism for this loss of resistance, whole genome sequencing and genetic variant analysis was performed and the CMD2 locus was fine-mapped to a 190 kilobase interval. Collectively, these data indicate that CMD2-type resistance is caused by a nonsynonymous, single nucleotide polymorphism in DNA polymerase $\delta$ subunit 1 (MePOLD1) located within this region. Virus-induced gene silencing of MePOLD1 in a CMD-susceptible cassava variety produced a recovery phenotype typical of CMD2-type resistance. Analysis of other CMD2-type cassava varieties identified additional candidate resistance alleles within MePOLD1. Genetic variation of MePOLD1, therefore, could represent an important genetic resource for resistance breeding and/or genome editing, and elucidating mechanisms of resistance to geminiviruses.",

abstract = "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRCRISPR)-Cas (CRISPR-associated system) has become the multipurpose tool to manipulate plant genome via their programmable sequence recognition, binding, and cleavage activities. Efficient plant genome modification often requires robust plant transformation. For most plant species, the CRISPRCRISPR/Cas reagents are delivered into plants as plasmids by Agrobacterium-mediated T-DNA transfer or biolistic approaches. However, these methods are generally inefficient, heavily genotype dependent, and low throughput. Among the alternative plant transformation approaches, the protoplast-based transformation holds the potential to directly deliver DNA, RNA, or protein molecules into plant cells in an efficient and high-throughput manner. Here, we presented a robust and simplified protocol for protoplast-based DNA/ribonucleoproteinRibonucleoprotein (RNP)(RNPRibonucleoprotein (RNP))-mediated genome editingGenome editing in the model species Nicotiana benthamiana. Using this protocol, we have achieved the gene editing efficiency at 30--60\% in protoplasts and 50--80\% in regenerated calli and plants. The edited protoplasts can be readily regenerated without selection agents owing to highly efficient DNA or preassembled RNPRibonucleoprotein (RNP)transformation frequency. Lastly, this protocol utilized an improved culture media regime to overcome the complex media composition used in the previous studies. It offers quick turnaround time and higher throughput to facilitate the development of new genetic engineering technologies and holds the promise to combine with other genetic and genomic tools for fundamental and translational plant research.",

abstract = "Precise editing of the plant genome has long been desired for functional genomic research and crop breeding. Prime editing is a newly developed precise editing technology based on CRISPR-Cas9, which uses an engineered reverse transcriptase (RT), a catalytically impaired Cas9 endonuclease (nCas9), and a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA). In addition, prime editing has a wider range of editing types than base editing and can produce nearly all types of edits. Although prime editing was first established in human cells, it has recently been applied to plants. As a relatively new technique, optimization will be needed to increase the editing efficiency in different crops. In this study, we successfully edited a mutant GFP in rice, peanut, chickpea, and cowpea protoplasts. In rice, up to 16 times higher editing efficiency was achieved with a dual pegRNA than the single pegRNA containing vectors. Edited-mutant GFP protoplasts have also been obtained in peanut, chickpea, and cowpea after transformation with the dual pegRNA vectors, albeit with much lower editing efficiency than in rice, ranging from 0.2\% to 0.5\%. These initial results promise to expedite the application of prime editing in legume breeding programs to accelerate crop improvement.",

abstract = "Deinococcus radiodurans is extremely resistant to ionizing radiation and has an exceptional ability to repair DNA damage caused by various DNA-damaging agents. D. radiodurans uses the same DNA-repair strategies as other prokaryotes, but certain proteins involved in the classical DNA repair machinery have characteristics different from their counterparts. RecG helicase, which unwinds a variety of branched DNA molecules, such as Holliday junctions (HJ) and D-loops, plays important roles in DNA repair, recombination, and replication. Primary sequence analysis of RecG from a number of bacterial species revealed that three amino acids (QPW) in the DNA-binding wedge domain (WD) are well-conserved across the Deinococcus RecG proteins. Interactions involving these conserved residues and DNA substrates were predicted in modeled domain structures of D. radiodurans RecG (DrRecG). Compared to the WD of Escherichia coli RecG protein (EcRecG) containing FSA amino acids corresponding to QPW in DrRecG, the HJ binding activity of DrRecG-WD was higher than that of EcRecG-WD. Reciprocal substitution of FSA and QPW increased and decreased the HJ binding activity of the mutant WDs, EcRecG-WDQPW, and DrRecG-WDFSA, respectively. Following $\gamma$-irradiation treatment, the reduced survival rate of DrRecG mutants ($\Delta$recG) was fully restored by the expression of DrRecG, but not by that of EcRecG. EcRecGQPW also enhanced $\gamma$-radioresistance of $\Delta$recG, whereas DrRecGFSA did not. $\Delta$recG cells complemented in trans by DrRecG and EcRecGQPW reconstituted an intact genome within 3 h post-irradiation, as did the wild-type strain, but $\Delta$recG with EcRecG and DrRecGFSA exhibited a delay in assembly of chromosomal fragments induced by $\gamma$-irradiation. These results suggested that the QPW residues facilitate the association of DrRecG with DNA junctions, thereby enhancing the DNA repair efficiency of DrRecG.",

Recent evidence suggests that R-loops are involved in a number of human diseases, including neurological disorders, cancer, and autoimmune diseases.

Cas9 nucleases complexed with a guide RNA (Cas9-gRNA) find their targets by scanning and interrogating the genomic DNA for sequences complementary to the gRNA. Recognition of the DNA target sequence requires a short protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) located outside this sequence. Given that the efficiency of target location may depend on the strength of interactions that promote target recognition, here we sought to compare affinities of different Cas9 nucleases for their cognate PAM sequences. To this end, we measured affinities of Cas9 nucleases from Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Francisella novicida complexed with guide RNAs (gRNAs) (SpCas9-gRNA, SaCas9-gRNA, and FnCas9-gRNA, respectively) and of three engineered SpCas9-gRNA variants with altered PAM specificities for short, PAM-containing DNA probes. We used a ``beacon'' assay that measures the relative affinities of DNA probes by determining their ability to competitively affect the rate of Cas9-gRNA binding to fluorescently labeled target DNA derivatives called ``Cas9 beacons.'' We observed significant differences in the affinities for cognate PAM sequences among the studied Cas9 enzymes. The relative affinities of SpCas9-gRNA and its engineered variants for canonical and suboptimal PAMs correlated with previous findings on the efficiency of these PAM sequences in genome editing. These findings suggest that high affinity of a Cas9 nuclease for its cognate PAM promotes higher genome-editing efficiency.",

The majority of T-ALL cases harbor activating mutations in NOTCH1 together with mutations in genes implicated in kinase signaling, transcriptional regulation, or protein translation. To obtain more insight in the level of clonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and during treatment, we used single-cell targeted DNA sequencing with the Tapestri platform. We designed a custom ALL panel and obtained accurate single-nucleotide variant and small insertion-deletion mutation calling for 305 amplicons covering 110 genes in about 4400 cells per sample and time point. A total of 108 188 cells were analyzed for 25 samples of 8 T-ALL patients. We typically observed a major clone at diagnosis (>35\% of the cells) accompanied by several minor clones of which some were less than 1\% of the total number of cells. Four patients had >2 NOTCH1 mutations, some of which present in minor clones, indicating a strong pressure to acquire NOTCH1 mutations in developing T-ALL cells. By analyzing longitudinal samples, we detected the presence and clonal nature of residual leukemic cells and clones with a minor presence at diagnosis that evolved to clinically relevant major clones at later disease stages. Therefore, single-cell DNA amplicon sequencing is a sensitive assay to detect clonal architecture and evolution in T-ALL.",

In this study, we show that chromatin open status is a pivotal determinant of the Cas9 editing activity in mammalian cells, and increasing chromatin accessibility can efficiently improve Cas9 genome editing. However, the strategy that increases chromatin openness by fusing the VP64 transcriptional activation domain at the C-terminus of Cas9 can only promote genome editing activity slightly at most tested CRISPR-Cas9 targets in Lenti-X 293T cells. Under the enlightenment that histone acetylation increases eukaryotic chromatin accessibility, we developed a composite strategy to further improve genome editing by activating histone acetylation. We demonstrate that promoting histone acetylation using the histone acetyltransferase activator YF-2 can improve the genome editing by Cas9 and, more robustly, by the Cas9 transcriptional activator (Cas9-AD). This strategy holds great potential to enhance CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and to enable broader CRISPR gRNA target choices for experiments in eukaryotes.",

Although some transgenic events showed simple insertions, others showed extreme genome damage in the form of chromosome truncations, large deletions, partial trisomy, and evidence of chromothripsis and breakage-fusion bridge cycling. Several transgenic events contained megabase-scale arrays of introduced DNA mixed with genomic fragments assembled by nonhomologous or microhomology-mediated joining. Damaged regions of the genome, assayed by the presence of small fragments displaced elsewhere, were often repaired without a trace, presumably by homology-dependent repair (HDR). The results suggest a model whereby successful biolistic transformation relies on a combination of end joining to insert foreign DNA and HDR to repair collateral damage caused by the microprojectiles. The differing levels of genome damage observed among transgenic events may reflect the stage of the cell cycle and the availability of templates for HDR.",

abstract = "DNA polymerase lambda (Pol lambda) is one of several DNA polymerases suggested to participate in base excision repair (BER), in repair of broken DNA ends and in translesion synthesis. It has been proposed that the nature of the DNA intermediates partly determines which polymerase is used for a particular repair reaction. To test this hypothesis, here we examine the ability of human Pol lambda to extend mismatched primer-termini, either on 'open' template-primer substrates, or on its preferred substrate, a 1 nt gapped-DNA molecule having a 5'-phosphate. Interestingly, Pol lambda extended mismatches with an average efficiency of approximately 10(-2) relative to matched base pairs. The match and mismatch extension catalytic efficiencies obtained on gapped molecules were approximately 260-fold higher than on template-primer molecules. A crystal structure of Pol lambda in complex with a single-nucleotide gap containing a dG.dGMP mismatch at the primer-terminus (2.40 A) suggests that, at least for certain mispairs, Pol lambda is unable to differentiate between matched and mismatched termini during the DNA binding step, thus accounting for the relatively high efficiency of mismatch extension. This property of Pol lambda suggests a potential role as a 'mismatch extender' during non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and possibly during translesion synthesis.",

abstract = "DNA polymerase $\lambda$ (Pol $\lambda$) is the sole member of family X DNA polymerase in plants and plays a crucial role in nuclear DNA damage repair. Here, we report the transcriptional up-regulation of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtPol$\lambda$ in response to abiotic and genotoxic stress, including salinity and the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C (MMC). The increased sensitivity of atpol$\lambda$ knockout mutants toward high salinity and MMC treatments, with higher levels of accumulation of double strand breaks (DSBs) than wild-type plants and delayed repair of DSBs, has suggested the requirement of Pol $\lambda$ in DSB repair in plants. AtPol$\lambda$ overexpression moderately complemented the deficiency of DSB repair capacity in atpol$\lambda$ mutants. Transcriptional up-regulation of major nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway genes KU80, X-RAY CROSS COMPLEMENTATION PROTEIN4 (XRCC4), and DNA Ligase4 (Lig4) along with AtPol$\lambda$ in Arabidopsis seedlings, and the increased sensitivity of atpol$\lambda$-2/atxrcc4 and atpol$\lambda$-2/atlig4 double mutants toward high salinity and MMC treatments, indicated the involvement of NHEJ-mediated repair of salinity- and MMC-induced DSBs. The suppressed expression of NHEJ genes in atpol$\lambda$ mutants suggested complex transcriptional regulation of NHEJ genes. Pol $\lambda$ interacted directly with XRCC4 and Lig4 via its N-terminal breast cancer-associated C terminus (BRCT) domain in a yeast two-hybrid system, while increased sensitivity of BRCT-deficient Pol $\lambda$-expressing transgenic atpol$\lambda$-2 mutants toward genotoxins indicated the importance of the BRCT domain of AtPol$\lambda$ in mediating the interactions for processing DSBs. Our findings provide evidence for the direct involvement of DNA Pol $\lambda$ in the repair of DSBs in a plant genome.",

DNA helicases are essential for unwinding this double strand when it comes to replication, repair or transcription of genetic information. In this review, we will focus on what is known about a variety of DNA helicases that are required to ensure genome stability in plants. Due to their sessile lifestyle, plants are especially exposed to harmful environmental factors. Moreover, many crop plants have large and highly repetitive genomes, making them absolutely dependent on the correct interplay of DNA helicases for safeguarding their stability. Although basic features of a number of these enzymes are conserved between plants and other eukaryotes, a more detailed analysis shows surprising peculiarities, partly also between different plant species. This is additionally of high relevance for plant breeding as a number of these helicases are also involved in crossover control during meiosis and influence the outcome of different approaches of CRISPR/Cas based plant genome engineering. Thus, gaining knowledge about plant helicases, their interplay, as well as the manipulation of their pathways, possesses the potential for improving agriculture. In the long run, this might even help us cope with the increasing obstacles of climate change threatening food security in completely new ways.",

Related to this, several targeted DNA-damage response inhibitors (DDRis) are being tested in the clinic and have been shown to potentiate anti-tumor immune responses. Seminal studies have shown that these agents are highly effective in a pan-cancer class of tumors with genetic defects in key DNA repair genes such as BRCA1/2, BRCA-related genes, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), and others. Here, we review the molecular consequences of targeted DDR inhibition, from tumor cell death to increased engagement of the anti-tumor immune response. Additionally, we discuss mechanistic and clinical rationale for pairing targeted DDRis with immunotherapy for enhanced tumor control.

In mammalian cells, the DNA polymerase (pol) family X enzyme DNA pol $\lambda$ catalyzes the correct incorporation of C opposite 8-oxo-G, together with the auxiliary factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Here, we show that Arabidopsis thaliana DNA pol $\lambda$, the only member of the X family in plants, is as efficient in performing error-free translesion synthesis past 8-oxo-G as its mammalian homolog. Arabidopsis, in contrast with animal cells, possesses two genes for PCNA. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we observed that PCNA2, but not PCNA1, physically interacts with DNA pol $\lambda$, enhancing its fidelity and efficiency in translesion synthesis. The levels of DNA pol $\lambda$ in transgenic plantlets characterized by overexpression or silencing of Arabidopsis POLL correlate with the ability of cell extracts to perform error-free translesion synthesis. The important role of DNA pol $\lambda$ is corroborated by the observation that the promoter of POLL is activated by UV and that both overexpressing and silenced plants show altered growth phenotypes.",

The development of virus-based methods of CRISPR-Cas system delivery into the plant cells holds great promise to overcome these limitations. Here, we perform direct inoculation of wheat leaves with the barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) transcripts to deliver guide RNAs (sgRNA) into the Cas9-expressing wheat. We demonstrate that wheat inoculation with the pool of BSMV-sgRNAs could be used to generate heritable precise deletions in the promoter region of a transcription factor and to perform multiplexed editing of agronomic genes. We transfer the high-expressing locus of Cas9 into adapted spring and winter cultivars by marker-assisted introgression and use of the BSMV-sgRNAs to edit two agronomic genes. A strategy presented in our study could be applied to any adapted cultivar for creating new cis-regulatory diversity or large-scale editing of multiple genes in biological pathways or QTL regions, opening possibilities for the effective engineering of crop genomes, and accelerating gene discovery and trait improvement efforts.",

abstract = "Viral vectors are being engineered to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 components systemically in plants to induce somatic or heritable site-specific mutations. It is hypothesized that RNA mobility signals facilitate entry of viruses or single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) into the shoot apical meristem where germline mutations can occur. Our objective was to understand the impact of RNA mobility signals on virus-induced somatic and germline gene editing in Nicotiana benthamiana and Zea mays. Previously, we showed that foxtail mosaic virus (FoMV) expressing sgRNA induced somatic mutations in N. benthamiana and Z. mays expressing Cas9. Here, we fused RNA mobility signals to sgRNAs targeting the genes encoding either N. benthamiana phytoene desaturase (PDS) or Z. mays high affinity potassium transporter 1 (HKT1). Addition of Arabidopsis thaliana Flowering Locus T (AtFT) and A. thaliana tRNA-Isoleucine (AttRNAIle) did not improve FoMV-induced somatic editing, and neither were sufficient to facilitate germline mutations in N. benthamiana. Maize FT homologs, Centroradialus 16 (ZCN16) and ZCN19, as well as AttRNAIle were found to aid somatic editing in maize but did not enable sgRNAs delivered by FoMV to induce germline mutations. Additional viral guide RNA delivery systems were assessed for somatic and germline mutations in N. benthamiana with the intention of gaining a better understanding of the specificity of mobile signal-facilitated germline editing. Potato virus X (PVX), barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV), and tobacco rattle virus (TRV) were included in this comparative study, and all three of these viruses delivering sgRNA were able to induce somatic and germline mutations. Unexpectedly, PVX, a potexvirus closely related to FoMV, expressing sgRNA alone induced biallelic edited progeny, indicating that mobility signals are dispensable in virus-induced germline editing. These results show that PVX, BSMV, and TRV expressing sgRNA all have an innate ability to induce mutations in the germline. Our results indicate that mobility signals alone may not be sufficient to enable virus-based delivery of sgRNAs using the viruses, FoMV, PVX, BSMV, and TRV into cell types that result in germline mutations.",

In this study, we engineered a barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-based gRNA delivery system for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis in wheat and maize. BSMV-based delivery of single gRNAs for targeted mutagenesis was first validated in Nicotiana benthamiana. To extend this work, we transformed wheat and maize with the Cas9 nuclease gene and selected the wheat TaGASR7 and maize ZmTMS5 genes as targets to assess the feasibility and efficiency of BSMV-mediated mutagenesis. Positive targeted mutagenesis of the TaGASR7 and ZmTMS5 genes was achieved for wheat and maize with efficiencies of up to 78\% and 48\%. Our results provide a useful tool for fast and efficient delivery of gRNAs into economically important crops.",

abstract = "Enzymatic processing of DNA underlies all DNA repair, yet inappropriate DNA processing must be avoided. In vertebrates, double-strand breaks are repaired predominantly by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which directly ligates DNA ends. NHEJ has the potential to be highly mutagenic because it uses DNA polymerases, nucleases, and other enzymes that modify incompatible DNA ends to allow their ligation. Using frog egg extracts that recapitulate NHEJ, we show that end processing requires the formation of a ``short-range synaptic complex'' in which DNA ends are closely aligned in a ligation-competent state. Furthermore, single-molecule imaging directly demonstrates that processing occurs within the short-range complex. This confinement of end processing to a ligation-competent complex ensures that DNA ends undergo ligation as soon as they become compatible, thereby minimizing mutagenesis. Our results illustrate how the coordination of enzymatic catalysis with higher-order structural organization of substrate maximizes the fidelity of DNA repair.",

Here, we report that disrupting CtIP or FANCD2, which have roles in alternative non-homologous end joining, enhances precise DNA-fragment deletion. By analyzing the inserted nucleotides at the junctions of DNA-fragment editing of deletions, inversions, and duplications and characterizing the cleaved products, we find that Cas9 endonucleolytically cleaves the noncomplementary strand with a flexible scissile profile upstream of the -3 position of the PAM site in vivo and in vitro, generating double-strand break ends with 5' overhangs of 1-3 nucleotides. Moreover, we find that engineered Cas9 nucleases have distinct cleavage profiles. Finally, Cas9-mediated nucleotide insertions are nonrandom and are equal to the combined sequences upstream of both PAM sites with predicted frequencies. Thus, precise and predictable DNA-fragment editing could be achieved by perturbing DNA repair genes and using appropriate PAM configurations.",

abstract = "Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are one of the most harmful DNA lesions. Cells utilize two main pathways for DSB repair: homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). NHEJ can be subdivided into the KU-dependent classical NHEJ (c-NHEJ) and the more error-prone KU-independent backup-NHEJ (b-NHEJ) pathways, involving the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). However, in the absence of these factors, cells still seem able to adequately maintain genome integrity, suggesting the presence of other b-NHEJ repair factors or pathways independent from KU and PARPs. The outcome of DSB repair by NHEJ pathways can be investigated by using artificial sequence-specific nucleases such as CRISPR/Cas9 to induce DSBs at a target of interest. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 for DSB induction at the Arabidopsis cruciferin 3 (CRU3) and protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) genes. DSB repair outcomes via NHEJ were analyzed using footprint analysis in wild-type plants and plants deficient in key factors of c-NHEJ (ku80), b-NHEJ (parp1 parp2), or both (ku80 parp1 parp2). We found that larger deletions of >20 bp predominated after DSB repair in ku80 and ku80 parp1 parp2 mutants, corroborating with a role of KU in preventing DSB end resection. Deletion lengths did not significantly differ between ku80 and ku80 parp1 parp2 mutants, suggesting that a KU- and PARP-independent b-NHEJ mechanism becomes active in these mutants. Furthermore, microhomologies and templated insertions were observed at the repair junctions in the wild type and all mutants. Since these characteristics are hallmarks of polymerase $\vartheta$-mediated DSB repair, we suggest a possible role for this recently discovered polymerase in DSB repair in plants.",

abstract = "Canonical CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique has profoundly impacted the fields of plant biology, biotechnology, and crop improvement. Since non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is usually considered to generate random indels, its high efficiency mutation is generally not pertinent to precise editing. Homology-directed repair (HDR) can mediate precise editing with supplied donor DNA, but it suffers from extreme low efficiency in higher plants. Therefore, precision editing in plants will be facilitated by the ability to predict NHEJ repair outcome and to improve HDR efficiency. Here, we report that NHEJ-mediated single nucleotide insertion at different rice genes is predictable based on DNA sequences at the target loci. Three mutation prediction tools (inDelphi, FORECasT, and SPROUT) have been validated in the rice plant system. We also evaluated the chimeric guide RNA (cgRNA) and Cas9-Retron precISe Parallel Editing via homologY (CRISPEY) strategies to facilitate donor template supply for improving HDR efficiency in Nicotiana benthamiana and rice. However, neither cgRNA nor CRISPEY improved plant HDR editing efficiency in this study. Interestingly, our data indicate that tethering of 200-250 nucleotides long sequence to either 5' or 3' ends of guide RNA did not significantly affect Cas9 cleavage activity.",

However, if deployed in an inappropriate cellular context, these same repair functions can mediate chromosome rearrangements that underlie various human diseases, ranging from developmental disorders to cancer. The two major mechanisms of DSB repair in mammalian cells are non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination. In this Review, we consider DSB repair-pathway choice in somatic mammalian cells as a series of 'decision trees', and explore how defective pathway choice can lead to genomic instability. Stalled, collapsed or broken DNA replication forks present a distinctive challenge to the DSB repair system. Emerging evidence suggests that the 'rules' governing repair-pathway choice at stalled replication forks differ from those at replication-independent DSBs.",

abstract = "The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination (HR) is initiated by nucleolytic degradation of the 5'-terminated strands in a process termed end resection. End resection generates 3'-single-stranded DNA tails, substrates for Rad51 to catalyze homologous pairing and DNA strand exchange, and for activation of the DNA damage checkpoint. The commonly accepted view is that end resection occurs by a two-step mechanism. In the first step, Sae2/CtIP activates the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2/Nbs1 (MRX/N) complex to endonucleolytically cleave the 5'-terminated DNA strands close to break ends, and in the second step Exo1 and/or Dna2 nucleases extend the resected tracts to produce long 3'-ssDNA-tailed intermediates. Initiation of resection commits a cell to repair a DSB by HR because long ssDNA overhangs are poor substrates for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Thus, the initiation of end resection has emerged as a critical control point for repair pathway choice. Here, I review recent studies on the mechanism of end resection and how this process is regulated to ensure the most appropriate repair outcome.",

DSBs are considered one of the most deleterious forms of DNA damage and must be quickly recognized and repaired. Telomeres, on the other hand, are specialized, stable DNA ends that must be protected from recognition as DSBs to inhibit unwanted chromosome fusions. Decisions to join DNA ends, or not, are therefore critical to genome stability. Yet, the processing of telomeres and DSBs share many commonalities. Accordingly, key decision points are used to shift DNA ends toward DSB repair vs. end protection. Additionally, DSBs can be repaired by two major pathways, namely homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The choice of which repair pathway is employed is also dictated by a series of decision points that shift the break toward HR or NHEJ. In this review, we will focus on these decision points and the mechanisms that dictate end protection vs. DSB repair and DSB repair choice.",

abstract = "Enzymatic processing of DNA underlies all DNA repair, yet inappropriate DNA processing must be avoided. In vertebrates, double-strand breaks are repaired predominantly by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which directly ligates DNA ends. NHEJ has the potential to be highly mutagenic because it uses DNA polymerases, nucleases, and other enzymes that modify incompatible DNA ends to allow their ligation. Using frog egg extracts that recapitulate NHEJ, we show that end processing requires the formation of a ``short-range synaptic complex'' in which DNA ends are closely aligned in a ligation-competent state. Furthermore, single-molecule imaging directly demonstrates that processing occurs within the short-range complex. This confinement of end processing to a ligation-competent complex ensures that DNA ends undergo ligation as soon as they become compatible, thereby minimizing mutagenesis. Our results illustrate how the coordination of enzymatic catalysis with higher-order structural organization of substrate maximizes the fidelity of DNA repair.",

Several improvements have been made to increase mutagenesis efficiency, either through vector optimisation or the application of heat stress. RESULTS: Here, we present a simplified heat stress assay that can be completed in six days using commonly-available laboratory equipment. We show that three heat shocks (3xHS) efficiently increases indel efficiency of LbCas12a and Cas9, irrespective of the target sequence or the promoter used to express the nuclease. The generated indels are primarily somatic, but for three out of five targets we demonstrate that up to 25\% more biallelic mutations are transmitted to the progeny when heat is applied compared to non-heat controls. We also applied our heat treatment to lines containing CRISPR base editors and observed a 22-27\% increase in the percentage of C-to-T base editing. Furthermore, we test the effect of 3xHS on generating large deletions and a homologous recombination reporter. Interestingly, we observed no positive effect of 3xHS treatment on either approach using our conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our experiments show that heat treatment is consistently effective at increasing the number of somatic mutations using many CRISPR approaches in plants and in some cases can increase the recovery of mutant progeny.",

These enzymes have the fidelity and processivity required to replicate long DNA sequences, but DNA lesions can block their progression. Consequently, eukaryotic genomes also encode a variable number of specialized polymerases (between five and 16 depending on the organism) that are involved in the replication of damaged DNA, DNA repair, and organellar DNA replication. This diversity of enzymes likely stems from their ability to bypass specific types of lesions. In the past 10-15 years, our knowledge regarding plant DNA polymerases dramatically increased.

OsPol lambda had activities of DNA polymerase, terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase and deoxyribose phosphate lyase, a marker enzyme for base excision repair. It also interacted with rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen (OsPCNA) in a pull-down assay. OsPCNA increased the processivity of OsPol lambda. Northern blot analysis showed that the level of OsPol lambda expression correlated with cell proliferation in meristematic and meiotic tissues, and was induced by DNA-damaging treatments.

abstract = "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are harmful lesions leading to genomic instability or diversity. Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is a prominent DSB repair pathway, which has long been considered to be error-prone. However, recent data have pointed to the intrinsic precision of NHEJ. Three reasons can account for the apparent fallibility of NHEJ: 1) the existence of a highly error-prone alternative end-joining process; 2) the adaptability of canonical C-NHEJ (Ku- and Xrcc4/ligase IV-dependent) to imperfect complementary ends; and 3) the requirement to first process chemically incompatible DNA ends that cannot be ligated directly. Thus, C-NHEJ is conservative but adaptable, and the accuracy of the repair is dictated by the structure of the DNA ends rather than by the C-NHEJ machinery. We present data from different organisms that describe the conservative/versatile properties of C-NHEJ. The advantages of the adaptability/versatility of C-NHEJ are discussed for the development of the immune repertoire and the resistance to ionizing radiation, especially at low doses, and for targeted genome manipulation.",

abstract = "The CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (spCas9) along with a single guide RNA (sgRNA) has emerged as a versatile toolbox for genome editing. Despite recent advances in the mechanism studies on spCas9-sgRNA-mediated double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) recognition and cleavage, it is still unclear how the catalytic Mg2+ ions induce the conformation changes toward the catalytic active state. It also remains controversial whether Cas9 generates blunt-ended or staggered-ended breaks with overhangs in the DNA. To investigate these issues, here we performed the first all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the spCas9-sgRNA-dsDNA system with and without Mg2+ bound. The simulation results showed that binding of two Mg2+ ions at the RuvC domain active site could lead to structurally and energetically favorable coordination ready for the non-target DNA strand cleavage. Importantly, we demonstrated with our simulations that Cas9-catalyzed DNA cleavage produces 1-bp staggered ends rather than generally assumed blunt ends.",

A previous study has shown that transgenic plants constitutively overexpressing ARGOS8 have reduced ethylene sensitivity and improved grain yield under drought stress conditions. To explore the targeted use of ARGOS8 native expression variation in drought-tolerant breeding, a diverse set of over 400 maize inbreds was examined for ARGOS8 mRNA expression, but the expression levels in all lines were less than that created in the original ARGOS8 transgenic events. We then employed a CRISPR-Cas-enabled advanced breeding technology to generate novel variants of ARGOS8. The native maize GOS2 promoter, which confers a moderate level of constitutive expression, was inserted into the 5'-untranslated region of the native ARGOS8 gene or was used to replace the native promoter of ARGOS8. Precise genomic DNA modification at the ARGOS8 locus was verified by PCR and sequencing. The ARGOS8 variants had elevated levels of ARGOS8 transcripts relative to the native allele and these transcripts were detectable in all the tissues tested, which was the expected results using the GOS2 promoter. A field study showed that compared to the WT, the ARGOS8 variants increased grain yield by five bushels per acre under flowering stress conditions and had no yield loss under well-watered conditions. These results demonstrate the utility of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in generating novel allelic variation for breeding drought-tolerant crops.",

Targeting the coding region of genes via the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-associated Protein (CRISPR/Cas) system has been well established and has enabled the rapid generation of transgene-free plants, which can lead to crop improvement. The emergence of the CRISPR/Cas system has also enabled scientists to achieve cis-regulatory element (CRE) editing and, consequently, engineering endogenous critical CREs to modulate the expression of target genes. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified the domestication of natural CRE variants to regulate complex agronomic quantitative traits and have allowed for their engineering via the CRISPR/Cas system. Although engineering plant CREs can be advantageous to drive gene expression, there are still many limitations to its practical application. Here, we review the current progress in CRE editing and propose future strategies to effectively target CREs for transcriptional regulation for crop improvement.",

We demonstrate the ability of CRISPRpath for simultaneously identifying functional enhancers of six genes in the 6-thioguanine--induced DNA mismatch repair pathway using both CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR nuclease (CRISPRn) approaches. Sixty percent of the identified enhancers are known promoters with distinct epigenomic features compared to other active promoters, including increased chromatin accessibility and interactivity. Furthermore, by imposing different levels of selection pressure, CRISPRpath can distinguish enhancers exerting strong impact on gene expression from those exerting weak impact. Our results offer a nuanced view of cis-regulation and demonstrate that CRISPRpath can be leveraged for understanding the complex gene regulatory program beyond transcriptional output at scale.",

Here, we engineered over 60 promoter alleles in two tomato fruit size genes3,4 to characterize cis-regulatory sequences and study their functional relationships. We found that targeted mutations in conserved promoter sequences of SlCLV3, a repressor of stem cell proliferation5,6, have a weak impact on fruit locule number. Pairwise combinations of these mutations mildly enhance this phenotype, revealing additive and synergistic relationships between conserved regions and further suggesting even higher-order cis-regulatory interactions within the SlCLV3 promoter. In contrast, SlWUS, a positive regulator of stem cell proliferation repressed by SlCLV3 (refs. 5,6), is more tolerant to promoter perturbations.

abstract = "Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is a critical error-prone pathway of double strand break repair. We recently showed that tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (Tdp1) regulates the accuracy of NHEJ repair junction formation in yeast. We assessed the role of other enzymes in the accuracy of junction formation using a plasmid repair assay. We found that exonuclease 1 (Exo1) is important in assuring accurate junction formation during NHEJ. Like tdp1$\Delta$ mutants, exo1$\Delta$ yeast cells repairing plasmids with 5'-extensions can produce repair junctions with templated insertions. We also found that exo1$\Delta$ mutants have a reduced median size of deletions when joining DNA with blunt ends. Surprisingly, exo1$\Delta$ pol4$\Delta$ mutants repair blunt ends with a very low frequency of deletions. This result suggests that there are multiple pathways that process blunt ends prior to end-joining. We propose that Exo1 acts at a late stage in end-processing during NHEJ. Exo1 can reverse nucleotide additions occurring due to polymerization, and may also be important for processing ends to expose microhomologies needed for NHEJ. We propose that accurate joining is controlled at two steps, a first step that blocks modification of DNA ends, which requires Tdp1, and a second step that occurs after synapsis that requires Exo1.",

The mechanisms of end synapsis and end processing have important implications for genome stability. Rapid and stable synapsis is necessary to limit chromosome translocations that result from the mispairing of DNA ends.

abstract = "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) threaten genomic stability, since their persistence can lead to loss of critical genetic information, chromosomal translocations or rearrangements, and cell death. DSBs can be repaired through the nonhomologous end-joining pathway (NHEJ), which processes and ligates DNA ends efficiently to prevent or minimize sequence loss. Polymerase $\lambda$ (Pol$\lambda$), one of the Family X polymerases, fills sequence gaps of DSB substrates with a strict specificity for a base-paired primer terminus. There is little information regarding Pol$\lambda$'s approach to engaging such substrates. We used in vitro polymerization and cell-based NHEJ assays to explore the contributions of conserved loop regions toward DSB substrate specificity and utilization. In addition, we present multiple crystal structures of Pol$\lambda$ in synapsis with varying biologically relevant DSB end configurations, revealing how key structural features and hydrogen bonding networks work in concert to stabilize these tenuous, potentially cytotoxic DNA lesions during NHEJ.",

abstract = "CRISPR-Cas9 is the state-of-the-art technology for editing and manipulating nucleic acids. However, the occurrence of off-target mutations can limit its applicability. Here, all-atom enhanced molecular dynamics (MD) simulations-using Gaussian accelerated MD (GaMD)-are used to decipher the mechanism of off-target binding at the molecular level. GaMD reveals that base pair mismatches in the target DNA at distal sites with respect to the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) can induce an extended opening of the RNA:DNA heteroduplex, which leads to newly formed interactions between the unwound DNA and the L2 loop of the catalytic HNH domain. These conserved interactions constitute a ``lock'' effectively decreasing the conformational freedom of the HNH domain and hampering its activation for cleavage. Remarkably, depending on their positions at PAM distal sites, DNA mismatches responsible for off-target cleavages are unable to ``lock'' the HNH domain, thereby leading to the unselective cleavage of DNA sequences. In consistency with the available experimental data, the ability to ``lock'' the catalytic HNH domain in an inactive ``conformational checkpoint'' is shown to be a key determinant in the onset of off-target effects. This mechanistic rationale contributes in clarifying a long lasting open issue in the CRISPR-Cas9 function and poses the foundation for designing novel and more specific Cas9 variants, which could be obtained by magnifying the ``locking'' interactions between HNH and the target DNA in the presence of any incorrect off-target sequence, thus preventing undesired cleavages.",

Despite recent advances in the mechanism studies on spCas9-sgRNA-mediated double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) recognition and cleavage, it is still unclear how the catalytic Mg2+ ions induce the conformation changes toward the catalytic active state. It also remains controversial whether Cas9 generates blunt-ended or staggered-ended breaks with overhangs in the DNA. To investigate these issues, here we performed the first all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the spCas9-sgRNA-dsDNA system with and without Mg2+ bound. The simulation results showed that binding of two Mg2+ ions at the RuvC domain active site could lead to structurally and energetically favorable coordination ready for the non-target DNA strand cleavage. Importantly, we demonstrated with our simulations that Cas9-catalyzed DNA cleavage produces 1-bp staggered ends rather than generally assumed blunt ends.",

abstract = "CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful tool for target genome editing in living cells. Significant advances have been made to understand how this system cleaves target DNA. HNH is a nuclease domain, which shares structural similarity with the HNH endonuclease characterzied by a beta-beta-alpha-metal fold. Therefore, based on one- and two-metal-ion mechanisms, homology modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation are suitable tools for building an atomic model of Cas9 in the DNA cleavage state. Here, by modeling and MD, we presented an atomic model of SpCas9-sgRNA-DNA complex with the cleavage state. This model shows that the HNH and RuvC conformations resemble their DNA cleavage state where the active-sites in the complex coordinate with DNA, Mg2+ ions, and water. Among them, residues D10, E762, H983, and D986 locate at the first shell of the RuvC active-site and interact with the ions directly, residues H982 or/and H985 are general (Lewis) bases, and the coordinated water is located at the positions for nucleophilic attack of the scissile phosphate. Meanwhile, this catalytic model led us to engineer a new SpCas9 variant (SpCas9-H982A + H983D) with reduced off-target effects. Thus, our study provided new mechanistic insights into the CRISPR-Cas9 system in the DNA cleavage state and offered useful guidance for engineering new CRISPR-Cas9 editing systems with improved specificity.",

Here, we report a 5.2 {\AA} cryo-EM structure of Cas9 in complex with sgRNA and target DNA. This structure reveals a conformational state of Cas9 in which the HNH domain is closest to the DNA cleavage site. Compared with two known HNH states, our structure shows that the HNH active site moves toward the cleavage site by about 25 and 13 {\AA}, respectively. In combination with EM-based molecular dynamics simulations, we show that residues of the nuclease domains in our structure could form cleavage-compatible conformations with the target DNA.

abstract = "Synthetic chemical fluorescent dyes promise to be useful for many applications in biology. Covalent, targeted labeling, such as with a SNAP-tag, uses synthetic dyes to label specific proteins in vivo for studying processes such as endocytosis or for imaging via super-resolution microscopy. Despite its potential, such chemical tagging has not been used effectively in plants. A major drawback has been the limited knowledge regarding cell wall and membrane permeability of the available synthetic dyes. Of 31 synthetic dyes tested here, 23 were taken up into BY-2 cells, while eight were not. This creates sets of dyes that can serve to measure endocytosis. Three of the dyes that were able to enter the cells, SNAP-tag ligands of diethylaminocoumarin, tetramethylrhodamine, and silicon-rhodamine 647, were used to SNAP-tag $\alpha$-tubulin. Successful tagging was verified by live cell imaging and visualization of microtubule arrays in interphase and during mitosis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings. Fluorescence activation-coupled protein labeling with DRBG-488 was used to observe PIN-FORMED2 (PIN2) endocytosis and delivery to the vacuole as well as preferential delivery of newly synthesized PIN2 to the actively forming cell plate during mitosis. Together, the data demonstrate that specific self-labeling of proteins can be used effectively in plants to study a wide variety of cellular and biological processes.",

We profiled H3.1 and H3.3 variants in the genome of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and found that the localization of these variants shows broad similarity in plants and animals, along with some unique features. H3.1 was enriched in silent areas of the genome, including regions containing the repressive chromatin modifications H3 lysine 27 methylation, H3 lysine 9 methylation, and DNA methylation. In contrast, H3.3 was enriched in actively transcribed genes, especially peaking at the 3' end of genes, and correlated with histone modifications associated with gene activation, such as histone H3 lysine 4 methylation and H2B ubiquitylation, as well as RNA Pol II occupancy. Surprisingly, both H3.1 and H3.3 were enriched on defined origins of replication, as was overall nucleosome density, suggesting a novel characteristic of plant origins. Our results are broadly consistent with the hypothesis that H3.1 acts as the canonical histone that is incorporated during DNA replication, whereas H3.3 acts as the replacement histone that can be incorporated outside of S-phase during chromatin-disrupting processes like transcription.",

Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated repair of DSBs, on the other hand, has been utilized for the induction of site-specific mutagenesis in plants. Since NHEJ is the dominant DSB repair pathway and can also lead to the capture of foreign DNA molecules, we suggest that it can also be deployed for gene replacement. An acceptor DNA molecule in which a green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding sequence (gfp) was flanked by ZFN recognition sequences was used to produce transgenic target plants. A donor DNA molecule in which a promoterless hygromycin B phosphotransferase-encoding gene (hpt) was flanked by ZFN recognition sequences was constructed. The donor DNA molecule and ZFN expression cassette were delivered into target plants. ZFN-mediated site-specific mutagenesis and complete removal of the GFP coding sequence resulted in the recovery of hygromycin-resistant plants that no longer expressed GFP and in which the hpt gene was unlinked to the acceptor DNA. More importantly, ZFN-mediated digestion of both donor and acceptor DNA molecules resulted in NHEJ-mediated replacement of the gfp with hpt and recovery of hygromycin-resistant plants that no longer expressed GFP and in which the hpt gene was physically linked to the acceptor DNA. Sequence and phenotypical analyses, and transmission of the replacement events to the next generation, confirmed the stability of the NHEJ-induced gene exchange, suggesting its use as a novel method for transgene replacement and gene stacking in plants.",

This method uses a zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) to create a site-specific double-strand break (DSB) that facilitates copying of genetic information into the chromosome from an exogenous donor molecule. Such donors typically contain two approximately 750 bp regions of chromosomal sequence required for homology-directed DNA repair. Here, we demonstrate that easily-generated linear donors with extremely short (50 bp) homology regions drive transgene integration into 5-10\% of chromosomes. Moreover, we measure the overhangs produced by ZFN cleavage and find that oligonucleotide donors with single-stranded 5' overhangs complementary to those made by ZFNs are efficiently ligated in vivo to the DSB. Greater than 10\% of all chromosomes directly incorporate this exogenous DNA via a process that is dependent upon and guided by complementary 5' overhangs on the donor DNA. Finally, we extend this non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-based technique by directly inserting donor DNA comprising recombinase sites into large deletions created by the simultaneous action of two separate ZFN pairs. Up to 50\% of deletions contained a donor insertion. Targeted DNA addition via NHEJ complements our homology-directed targeted integration approaches, adding versatility to the manipulation of mammalian genomes.",

abstract = "Mutations are the source of both genetic diversity and mutational load. However, the effects of increasing environmental temperature on plant mutation rates and relative impact on specific mutational classes (e.g., insertion/deletion [indel] vs. single nucleotide variant [SNV]) are unknown. This topic is important because of the poorly defined effects of anthropogenic global temperature rise on biological systems. Here, we show the impact of temperature increase on Arabidopsis thaliana mutation, studying whole genome profiles of mutation accumulation (MA) lineages grown for 11 successive generations at 29°C. Whereas growth of A. thaliana at standard temperature (ST; 23°C) is associated with a mutation rate of 7 $\times$ 10-9 base substitutions per site per generation, growth at stressful high temperature (HT; 29°C) is highly mutagenic, increasing the mutation rate to 12 $\times$ 10-9 SNV frequency is approximately two- to threefold higher at HT than at ST, and HT-growth causes an ∼19- to 23-fold increase in indel frequency, resulting in a disproportionate increase in indels (vs. SNVs). Most HT-induced indels are 1-2 bp in size and particularly affect homopolymeric or dinucleotide A or T stretch regions of the genome. HT-induced indels occur disproportionately in nucleosome-free regions, suggesting that much HT-induced mutational damage occurs during cell-cycle phases when genomic DNA is packaged into nucleosomes. We conclude that stressful experimental temperature increases accelerate plant mutation rates and particularly accelerate the rate of indel mutation. Increasing environmental temperatures are thus likely to have significant mutagenic consequences for plants growing in the wild and may, in particular, add detrimentally to mutational load.",

The cold signaling attenuator HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENE1 (HOS1) negatively regulates cold responses. Notably, HOS1-deficient mutants exhibit early flowering, and FLC expression is suppressed in the mutants. However, it remains unknown how HOS1 regulates FLC expression. Here, we show that HOS1 induces FLC expression by antagonizing the actions of FVE and its interacting partner histone deacetylase 6 (HDA6) under short-term cold stress. HOS1 binds to FLC chromatin in an FVE-dependent manner, and FVE is essential for the HOS1-mediated activation of FLC transcription. HOS1 also interacts with HDA6 and inhibits the binding of HDA6 to FLC chromatin. Intermittent cold treatments induce FLC expression by activating HOS1, which attenuates the activity of HDA6 in silencing FLC chromatin, and the effects of intermittent cold are diminished in hos1 and fve mutants. These observations indicate that HOS1 acts as a chromatin remodeling factor for FLC regulation under short-term cold stress.",

abstract = "Heat stress limits plant growth, development, and crop yield, but how plant cells precisely sense and transduce heat stress signals remains elusive. Here, we identified a conserved heat stress response mechanism to elucidate how heat stress signal is transmitted from the cytoplasm into the nucleus for epigenetic modifiers. We demonstrate that HISTONE DEACETYLASE 9 (HDA9) transduces heat signals from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to play a positive regulatory role in heat responses in Arabidopsis. Heat specifically induces HDA9 accumulation in the nucleus. Under heat stress, the phosphatase PP2AB'$\beta$ directly interacts with and dephosphorylates HDA9 to protect HDA9 from 26S proteasome-mediated degradation, leading to the translocation of nonphosphorylated HDA9 to the nucleus. This heat-induced enrichment of HDA9 in the nucleus depends on the nucleoporin HOS1. In the nucleus, HDA9 binds and deacetylates the target genes related to signaling transduction and plant development to repress gene expression in a transcription factor YIN YANG 1-dependent and -independent manner, resulting in rebalance of plant development and heat response. Therefore, we uncover an HDA9-mediated positive regulatory module in the heat shock signal transduction pathway. More important, this cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation of HDA9 in response to heat stress is conserved in wheat and rice, which confers the mechanism significant implication potential for crop breeding to cope with global climate warming.",

Yet, heat is a critical obstacle to plant survival. The deleterious effects of heat shock on cell function include misfolding of cellular proteins, disruption of cytoskeletons and membranes, and disordering of RNA metabolism and genome integrity3-5. Plants stimulate diverse heat shock response pathways in response to abrupt temperature increases. While it is known that stressful high temperatures disturb genome integrity by causing nucleotide modifications and strand breakages or impeding DNA repair6, it is largely unexplored how plants cope with heat-induced DNA damages. Here, we demonstrated that high expression of osmotically reponsive genes 1 (HOS1) induces thermotolerance by activating DNA repair components. Thermotolerance and DNA repair capacity were substantially reduced in HOS1-deficient mutants, in which thermal induction of genes encoding DNA repair systems, such as the DNA helicase RECQ2, was markedly decreased. Notably, HOS1 proteins were thermostabilized in a heat shock factor A1/heat shock protein 90 (HSP90)-dependent manner. Our data indicate that the thermoresponsive HSP90-HOS1-RECQ2 module contributes to sustaining genome integrity during the acquisition of thermotolerance, providing a distinct molecular link between DNA repair and thermotolerance.",

We achieved this by harnessing the temperate phage GIL16 DNA replication machinery in Bacillus thuringiensis with an engineered error-prone orthogonal DNA polymerase. BacORep introduces all 12 types of nucleotide substitution in 15-kilobase genes on orthogonally replicating linear plasmids with a 6,700-fold higher mutation rate than that of the host genome, the mutation rate of which is unchanged. Here we demonstrate the utility of BacORep-based continuous evolution by generating strong promoters applicable to model bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli, and achieving a 7.4-fold methanol assimilation increase in B. thuringiensis.

All these properties support a role of DNA polymerase lambda in base excision repair. On the other hand, the biochemical properties of the polymerisation activity of DNA polymerase lambda are still largely unknown. Here we give evidence that human DNA polymerase lambda has an intrinsic terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase activity that preferentially adds pyrimidines onto 3'OH ends of DNA oligonucleotides. Furthermore, human DNA polymerase lambda efficiently elongates an RNA primer hybridized to a DNA template. These two novel properties of human DNA polymerase lambda might suggest additional roles for this enzyme in DNA replication and repair processes.",

abstract = "Repair of DNA double strand breaks by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) requires enzymatic processing beyond simple ligation when the terminal bases are damaged or not fully compatible. We transformed yeast with a series of linearized plasmids to examine the role of Pol4 (Pol IV, DNA polymerase beta) in repair at a variety of end configurations. Mutation of POL4 did not impair DNA polymerase-independent religation of fully compatible ends and led to at most a 2-fold reduction in the frequency of joins that require only DNA polymerization. In contrast, the frequency of joins that also required removal of a 5'- or 3'-terminal mismatch was markedly reduced in pol4 (but not rev3, exo1, apn1, or rad1) yeast. In a chromosomal double strand break assay, pol4 mutation conferred a marked increase in sensitivity to HO endonuclease in a rad52 background, due primarily to loss of an NHEJ event that anneals with a 3'-terminal mismatch. The NHEJ activity of Pol4 was dependent on its nucleotidyl transferase function, as well as its unique amino terminus. Paradoxically, in vitro analyses with oligonucleotide substrates demonstrated that although Pol4 fills gaps with displacement of mismatched but not matched 5' termini, it lacks both 5'- and 3'-terminal nuclease activities. Pol4 is thus specifically recruited to perform gap-filling in an NHEJ pathway that must also involve as yet unidentified nucleases.",

Pol4 also interacts directly with the Dnl4 subunit of the Dnl4-Lif1 complex via its N-terminal BRCT domain. This interaction stimulates the DNA synthesis activity of Pol4 and, to a lesser extent, the DNA joining activity of Dnl4-Lif1. Notably, the joining of DNA substrates that require the combined action of Pol4 and Dnl4-Lif1 is much more efficient than the joining of similar DNA substrates that require only ligation. Thus, the physical and functional interactions between Pol4 and Dnl4-Lif1 provide a molecular mechanism for both the recruitment of Pol4 to in vivo DNA double-strand breaks and the coupling of the gap filling DNA synthesis and DNA joining reactions that complete the microhomology-mediated pathway of nonhomologous end joining.",

We have identified a homologue to Exonuclease-1 from rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) and have designated it O. sativa Exonuclease-1 (OsEXO1). The open reading frame of OsEXO1 encodes a predicted product of 836 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 92 kDa. Two highly conserved nuclease domains (XPG-N and XPG-I) are present in the N-terminal region of the protein. OsEXO1-sGFP fusion protein transiently overexpressed in the onion epidermal cells localized to the nucleus. The transcript of OsEXO1 is highly expressed in meristematic tissues and panicles. Inhibition of cell proliferation by removal of sucrose from the medium or by the addition of cell cycle inhibitors decreased OsEXO1 expression. Functional complementation assays using yeast RAD2 member null mutants demonstrates that OsEXO1 is able to substitute for ScEXO1 and ScRAD27 functions. Yeast two-hybrid analysis shows that OsEXO1 interacted with rice DNA polymerase lambda (OsPol lambda), the 70 kDa subunit b of rice replication protein A (OsRPA70b), and the 32 kDa subunit 1 of rice replication protein A (OsRPA32-1). Irradiation of UV-B induces OsEXO1 expression while hydrogen peroxide treatment represses it.

StCas9 and AsCas12 were not functional as tested, regardless of the temperature used. SpCas9 was the most efficient endonuclease at either temperature, regardless of whether monoallelic or biallelic edits were considered. Mb3Cas12a at 37°C was the next most efficient endonuclease. Monoallelic edits prevailed for both SaCas9 and Mb3Cas12a at 27°C, but biallelic edits prevailed at 37°C. Overall, the use of other Cas9 orthologs, the use of Cas12a endonucleases, and the optimal temperature can expand the range of targetable sequences.",

Cold stress response in Arabidopsis root is directly linked to inhibition of the endosomal trafficking of auxin efflux carriers. However, the cellular components that link cold stress and the endosomal trafficking remain elusive. By screening available endosomal trafficking mutants against root growth recovery response under cold stress, we identified GNOM, a SEC7 containing ARF-GEF, as a major modulator of cold response. Contrasting response of partial loss of function mutant gnomB4049/emb30-1 and the engineered Brefeldin A (BFA)-resistant GNOM line, both of which contain mutations within SEC7 domain, to cold stress at the whole-plant level highlights the importance of this domain in modulating the cold response pathway of plants. Cold stress selectively and transiently inhibits GNOM expression. The engineered point mutation at 696 amino acid position (Methionine to Leucine) that makes GNOM resistant to BFA in fact results in overexpression of GNOM both at transcriptional and translational levels, and also alters its subcellular localization. Overexpression and altered cellular localization of GNOM were found to be directly linked to conferring striking cold-resistant phenotype in Arabidopsis. Collectively, these results provide a mechanistic link between GNOM, BFA-sensitive GNOM-regulated trafficking and cold stress.",

Here we used kinetics-guided cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of Cas9 at different stages of mismatch cleavage. We observed a distinct, linear conformation of the guide RNA-DNA duplex formed in the presence of mismatches, which prevents Cas9 activation. Although the canonical kinked guide RNA-DNA duplex conformation facilitates DNA cleavage, we observe that substrates that contain mismatches distal to the protospacer adjacent motif are stabilized by reorganization of a loop in the RuvC domain. Mutagenesis of mismatch-stabilizing residues reduces off-target DNA cleavage but maintains rapid on-target DNA cleavage. By targeting regions that are exclusively involved in mismatch tolerance, we provide a proof of concept for the design of next-generation high-fidelity Cas9 variants.",

Here, we have studied the effect of 450 DNA repair protein-Cas9 fusions on CRISPR genome editing outcomes. We find the majority of fusions to improve precision genome editing only modestly in a locus- and cell-type specific manner. We identify Cas9-POLD3 fusion that enhances editing by speeding up the initiation of DNA repair. We conclude that while DNA repair protein fusions to Cas9 can improve HDR CRISPR editing, most need to be optimized to the cell type and genomic site, highlighting the diversity of factors contributing to locus-specific genome editing outcomes.",

abstract = "Bacteria and archaea protect themselves from invasive foreign nucleic acids through an RNA-mediated adaptive immune system called CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/CRISPR-associated (Cas). Jinek et al. (p. 816, published online 28 June; see the Perspective by Brouns) found that for the type II CRISPR/Cas system, the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) as well as the trans-activating crRNA---which is known to be involved in the pre-crRNA processing---were both required to direct the Cas9 endonuclease to cleave the invading target DNA. Furthermore, engineered RNA molecules were able to program the Cas9 endonuclease to cleave specific DNA sequences to generate double-stranded DNA breaks. A prokaryotic RNA--directed targeting system can be designed to cleave any DNA sequence. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity against viruses and plasmids by using CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to guide the silencing of invading nucleic acids. We show here that in a subset of these systems, the mature crRNA that is base-paired to trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) forms a two-RNA structure that directs the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 to introduce double-stranded (ds) breaks in target DNA. At sites complementary to the crRNA-guide sequence, the Cas9 HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand, whereas the Cas9 RuvC-like domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand. The dual-tracrRNA:crRNA, when engineered as a single RNA chimera, also directs sequence-specific Cas9 dsDNA cleavage. Our study reveals a family of endonucleases that use dual-RNAs for site-specific DNA cleavage and highlights the potential to exploit the system for RNA-programmable genome editing.",

The unprocessed ends interact with Yku70p and Yku80p, two proteins required for NHEJ, but not significantly with Rad52p, a protein involved in homologous recombination (HR). Repair of a double-strand break by NHEJ is unaffected by the possibility of HR, although the use of HR is increased in NHEJ-defective cells. Partial in vitro 5' strand processing suppresses NHEJ but not HR. These results show that NHEJ precedes HR temporally, and that the availability of substrate dictates the particular pathway used. We propose that transient stability of DNA ends is a foundation for the permanent stability of telomeres.",

NHEJ plays a dominant role in repair of transposon excision sites in somatic cells. Artemis is dispensable for transposition, consistent with the lack of a hairpin structure at excision sites. Ku physically interacts with the SB transposase. DNA-PKcs is a limiting factor for transposition and, in addition to repair, has a function in transposition that is independent from its kinase activity.

Here, we triggered the excision of identified Mos1 insertions to create chromosomal breaks at given sites and further manipulate the broken loci. Double-strand break (DSB) repair could be achieved by gene conversion using a transgene containing sequences homologous to the broken chromosomal region as a repair template. Consequently, mutations engineered in the transgene could be copied to a specific locus at high frequency. This pathway was further characterized to develop an efficient tool?called MosTIC?to manipulate the C. elegans genome. Analysis of DSB repair during MosTIC experiments demonstrated that DSBs could also be sealed by end-joining in the germ line, independently from the evolutionarily conserved Ku80 and ligase IV factors. In conjunction with a publicly available Mos1 insertion library currently being generated, MosTIC will provide a general tool to customize the C. elegans genome.",

An efficient non-homologous end-joining-mediated targeted insertion method was recently developed by combining CRISPR/SpCas9 gene editing with phosphorothioate modified double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (dsODNs). Yet this approach often leads to imprecise insertions with no control over the insertion direction. Here, we compared the influence of chemical protection of dsODNs on efficiency of targeted insertion. We observed that CRISPR/SpCas9 frequently induced staggered cleavages with 1-nucleotide 5´overhangs; we also evaluated the effect of donor end structures on the direction and precision of targeted insertions. We demonstrate that chemically protected dsODNs with 1-nucleotide 5´ overhangs significantly improved the precision and direction control of target insertions in all tested CRISPR targeted sites. We applied this method to endogenous gene tagging in green foxtail (Setaria viridis), and engineering of cis-regulatory elements for disease resistance in rice (Oryza sativa). We directionally inserted two distinct transcription activator-like effector binding elements into the promoter region of a recessive rice bacterial blight resistance gene with up to 24.4\% efficiency. The resulting rice lines harboring heritable insertions exhibited strong resistance to infection by the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in an inducible and strain-specific manner.",

abstract = "Here, we have investigated the physical and molecular basis of stability of Arabidopsis DNA Pol $\lambda$, the sole X family DNA polymerase member in plant genome, under UV-B and salinity stress in connection with the function of the N-terminal BRCT (breast cancer-associated C terminus) domain and Ser-Pro rich region in the regulation of the overall structure of this protein. Tryptophan fluorescence studies, fluorescence quenching and Bis-ANS binding experiments using purified recombinant full length Pol $\lambda$ and its N-terminal deletion forms have revealed UV-B induced conformational change in BRCT domain deficient Pol $\lambda$. On the other hand, the highly conserved C-terminal catalytic core PolX domain maintained its tertiary folds under similar condition. Circular dichroism (CD) and fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectral studies have indicated appreciable change in the secondary structural elements in UV-B exposed BRCT domain deficient Pol $\lambda$. Increased thermodynamic stability of the C-terminal catalytic core domain suggested destabilizing effect of the N-terminal Ser-Pro rich region on the protein structure. Urea-induced equilibrium unfolding studies have revealed increased stability of Pol $\lambda$ and its N-terminal deletion mutants at high NaCl concentration. In vivo aggregation studies using transient expression systems in Arabidopsis and tobacco indicated possible aggregation of Pol $\lambda$ lacking the BRCT domain. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed interaction of Pol $\lambda$ with the eukaryotic molecular chaperone HSP90, suggesting the possibility of regulation of Pol $\lambda$ stability by HSP90 in plant cell. Overall, our results have provided one of the first comprehensive information on the biophysical characteristics of Pol $\lambda$ and indicated the importance of both BRCT and Ser-Pro rich modules in regulating the stability of this protein under genotoxic stress in plants.",

abstract = "DNA polymerase lambda (Pol lambda) is a member of the Pol X family having properties in common with several other mammalian DNA polymerases. To obtain clues to possible functions in vivo, we have determined the fidelity of DNA synthesis by human Pol lambda. The results indicate that the average single-base deletion error rate of Pol lambda is higher than those of other mammalian polymerases. In fact, unlike other DNA polymerases, Pol lambda generates single-base deletions at average rates that substantially exceed base substitution rates. Moreover, the sequence specificity for single-base deletions made by Pol lambda is different from that of other DNA polymerases and reveals that Pol lambda readily uses template-primers with limited base pair homology at the primer terminus. This ability, together with an ability to fill short gaps in DNA at low dNTP concentrations, is consistent with a role for mammalian Pol lambda in non-homologous end-joining. This may include non-homologous end-joining of strand breaks resulting from DNA damage, because Pol lambda has intrinsic 5',2'-deoxyribose-5-phosphate lyase activity.",

abstract = "Resting cells experience mutations without apparent external mutagenic influences. Such DNA replication-independent mutations are suspected to be a consequence of processing of spontaneous DNA lesions. Using experimental systems based on reversions of frameshift alleles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we evaluated the impact of defects in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair on the frequency of replication-independent mutations. The deletion of the genes coding for Ku70 or DNA ligase IV, which are both obligatory constituents of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, each resulted in a 50\% reduction of replication-independent mutation frequency in haploid cells. Sequencing indicated that typical NHEJ-dependent reversion events are small deletions within mononucleotide repeats, with a remarkable resemblance to DNA polymerase slippage errors. Experiments with diploid and RAD52- or RAD54-deficient strains confirmed that among DSB repair pathways only NHEJ accounts for a considerable fraction of replication-independent frameshift mutations in haploid and diploid NHEJ non-repressed cells. Thus our results provide evidence that G(0) cells with unrepressed NHEJ capacity pay for a large-scale chromosomal stability with an increased frequency of small-scale mutations, a finding of potential relevance for carcinogenesis.",

abstract = "In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an HO endonuclease-induced double-strand break can be repaired by at least two pathways of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) that closely resemble events in mammalian cells. In one pathway the chromosome ends are degraded to yield deletions with different sizes whose endpoints have 1 to 6 bp of homology. Alternatively, the 4-bp overhanging 3' ends of HO-cut DNA (5'-AACA-3') are not degraded but can be base paired in misalignment to produce +CA and +ACA insertions. When HO was expressed throughout the cell cycle, the efficiency of NHEJ repair was 30 times higher than when HO was expressed only in G1. The types of repair events were also very different when HO was expressed throughout the cell cycle; 78\% of survivors had small insertions, while almost none had large deletions. When HO expression was confined to the G1 phase, only 21\% were insertions and 38\% had large deletions. These results suggest that there are distinct mechanisms of NHEJ repair producing either insertions or deletions and that these two pathways are differently affected by the time in the cell cycle when HO is expressed. The frequency of NHEJ is unaltered in strains from which RAD1, RAD2, RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, or RAD57 is deleted; however, deletions of RAD50, XRS2, or MRE11 reduced NHEJ by more than 70-fold when HO was not cell cycle regulated. Moreover, mutations in these three genes markedly reduced +CA insertions, while significantly increasing the proportion of both small (-ACA) and larger deletion events. In contrast, the rad5O mutation had little effect on the viability of G1-induced cells but significantly reduced the frequency of both +CA insertions and -ACA deletions in favor of larger deletions. Thus, RAD50 (and by extension XRS2 and MRE11) exerts a much more important role in the insertion-producing pathway of NHEJ repair found in S and/or G2 than in the less frequent deletion events that predominate when HO is expressed only in G1.",

abstract = "The ends of spontaneously occurring double-strand breaks (DSBs) may contain various lengths of single-stranded DNA, blocking lesions, and gaps and flaps generated by end annealing. To investigate the processing of such structures, we developed an assay in which annealed oligonucleotides are ligated onto the ends of a linearized plasmid which is then transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Reconstitution of a marker occurs only when the oligonucleotides are incorporated and repair is in frame, permitting rapid analysis of complex DSB ends. Here, we created DSBs with compatible overhangs of various lengths and asked which pathways are required for their precise repair. Three mechanisms of rejoining were observed, regardless of overhang polarity: nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), a Rad52-dependent single-strand annealing-like pathway, and a third mechanism independent of the first two mechanisms. DSBs with overhangs of less than 4 bases were mainly repaired by NHEJ. Repair became less dependent on NHEJ when the overhangs were longer or had a higher GC content. Repair of overhangs greater than 8 nucleotides was as much as 150-fold more efficient, impaired 10-fold by rad52 mutation, and highly accurate. Reducing the microhomology extent between long overhangs reduced their repair dramatically, to less than NHEJ of comparable short overhangs. These data support a model in which annealing energy is a primary determinant of the rejoining efficiency and mechanism.",

author = "Emerson, Charlene H and Bertuch, Alison A",
abstract = "DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are dangerous sources of genome instability and must be repaired by the cell. Nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) is an evolutionarily conserved pathway to repair DSBs by direct ligation of the ends, with no requirement for a homologous template. While NHEJ is the primary DSB repair pathway in mammalian cells, conservation of the core NHEJ factors throughout eukaryotes makes the pathway attractive for study in model organisms. The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been used extensively to develop a functional picture of NHEJ. In this review, we will discuss the current understanding of NHEJ in S. cerevisiae. Topics include canonical end-joining, alternative end-joining, and pathway regulation. Particular attention will be paid to the NHEJ mechanism involving core factors, including Yku70/80, Dnl4, Lif1, and Nej1, as well as the various factors implicated in the processing of the broken ends. The relevance of chromatin dynamics to NHEJ will also be discussed. This review illustrates the use of S. cerevisiae as a powerful system to understand the principles of NHEJ, as well as in pioneering the direction of the field.",
